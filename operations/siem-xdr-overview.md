# Implement Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender XDR for Zero Trust

This solution guide walks through the process of setting up Microsoft eXtended detection and response (XDR) tools together with Microsoft Sentinel to accelerate your organization’s ability to respond to and remediate cybersecurity attacks.

Microsoft Defender XDR is an XDR solution that automatically collects, correlates, and analyzes signal, threat, and alert data from across your Microsoft 365 environment.

Microsoft Sentinel is a cloud-native solution that provides security information and event management (SIEM) and security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) capabilities. Together, Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender XDR provide a comprehensive solution to help organizations defend against modern attacks.

This guidance helps you mature your Zero Trust architecture by mapping the principles of Zero Trust in the following ways.

| Zero Trust Principle | Met by|
|--|:--|
| Verify explicitly | Microsoft Sentinel collects data from across the environment, performs analysis of threats and anomalies, and can respond with automation. <br><br> Microsoft Defender XDR provides extended detection and response across users, identities, devices, apps, and emails. Risk-based signals captured by Microsoft Defender XDR can be used by Microsoft Sentinel to take actions. |
| Use least privileged access | Microsoft Sentinel can detect anomalous activity through its User Entity Behavioral Analytics (UEBA) engine. <br><br>Threat Intelligence with Microsoft Sentinel can import threat intelligence data from Microsoft or third-party providers to detect new, emerging threats and provide extra context for investigations. <br><br> Microsoft Defender XDR has Microsoft Entra ID Protection, which can block users based on the level of risk with identity. Data can be fed into Microsoft Sentinel for further analysis and automation. |
| Assume breach | Microsoft Defender XDR continuously scans the environment for threats and vulnerabilities. Microsoft Sentinel analyzes collected data, behavioral trend of entities to detect suspicious activity, anomalies and multi-stage threats across enterprise.<br><br> Microsoft Sentinel has workbook visualizations that can help organizations harden the environment, such as the [Zero Trust workbook](/azure/sentinel/sentinel-solution). <br><br>Microsoft Defender XDR and Sentinel can implement automated remediation tasks, including automated investigations, device isolation, and data quarantine. Device risk can be used as a signal to feed into Microsoft Entra Conditional Access. |

## Microsoft Sentinel and XDR architecture

The following illustration shows how Microsoft's XDR solution seamlessly integrates with Microsoft Sentinel.

In this diagram:

- Insights from signals across your entire organization feed into Microsoft Defender XDR and Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
- Microsoft Defender XDR and Microsoft Defender for Cloud send SIEM log data through Microsoft Sentinel connectors.
- SecOps teams can then analyze and respond to threats identified in the Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender portals.
- Microsoft Sentinel provides support for multi-cloud environments and integrates with third-party apps and partners.

## Implementing Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender XDR for Zero Trust

Microsoft Defender XDR is an XDR solution that complements Microsoft Sentinel. An XDR pulls raw telemetry data from across multiple services like cloud applications, email security, identity, and access management.

Using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, the XDR then performs automatic analysis, investigation, and response in real time. The XDR solution also correlates security alerts into larger incidents, providing security teams greater visibility into attacks, and provides incident prioritization, helping analysts understand the risk level of the threat.

With Microsoft Sentinel, you can connect to many security sources using built-in connectors and industry standards. With its AI you can correlate multiple low fidelity signals spanning multiple sources to create a complete view of ransomware kill chain and prioritized alerts.

## Leveraging SIEM and XDR capabilities

In this section, we'll look into a typical attack scenario involving a phishing attack then proceed with how to respond to the incident with Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender XDR.

### Common attack order

The following diagram shows a common attack order of a phishing scenario. 

:::image type="content" source="./media/common-attack-defense.svg" alt-text="Image of a common attack scenario and defense from Microsoft security products" lightbox="./media/common-attack-defense.svg":::

The diagram also shows the Microsoft security products in place to detect each attack step and how attack signals and SIEM data flow to Microsoft Defender XDR and Microsoft Sentinel.

Here is a summary of the attack.

| Attack step | Detection service and signal source | Defenses in place |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Attacker sends phishing email  | Microsoft Defender for Office 365 | Protects mailboxes with advanced anti-phishing features that can protect against malicious impersonation-based phishing attacks. |
| 2. User opens attachment | Microsoft Defender for Office 365 | The Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Safe Attachments feature opens attachments in an isolated environment for additional scanning of threats (detonation). |
| 3. Attachment installs malware | Microsoft Defender for Endpoint | Protects endpoints from malware with its next generation protection features, such as cloud-delivered protection and behavior-based/heuristic/real-time antivirus protection. |
| 4. Malware steals user credentials | Microsoft Entra ID and Microsoft Entra ID Protection | Protects identities by monitoring user behavior and activities, detecting lateral movement, and alerting on anomalous activity. |
| 5. Attacker moves laterally across Microsoft 365 apps and data | Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps | Can detect anomalous activity of users accessing cloud apps. |
| 6. Attacker downloads sensitive files from a SharePoint folder | Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps | Can detect and respond to mass download events of files from SharePoint. |

### Incident response using Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender XDR

Now that we've seen how a common attack takes place, let's look into leveraging the integration of Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender XDR for incident response.

Here is the process of responding to an incident with Microsoft Defender XDR and Microsoft Sentinel:

1. Triage the incident in the Microsoft Sentinel portal.
2. Move over to the Microsoft Defender portal to start your investigation.
3. Where needed, continue the investigation in the Microsoft Sentinel portal.
4. Resolve the incident in the Microsoft Sentinel portal.

The following diagram shows the process, starting with discovery and triage in Microsoft Sentinel.
