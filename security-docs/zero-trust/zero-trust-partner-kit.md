## Co-branded architecture illustrations

### Visio templates, Visio stencils, and Microsoft icon sets

To help you work with reference architectures in the Zero  Trust guidance center, you can download co-branded Visio template files along with Microsoft icon sets. 

These 11x17 Visio template files are co-branded and leave plenty of room for your own work. Replace the Contoso logo with your own logo. Try out the template file that's themed with Microsoft Security colors. Or, work with the unthemed template file if you're not getting the results you want.

To download additional Visio templates and, more importantly, Visio stencil files that include Microsoft icons, see [Microsoft 365 architecture templates and icons](/microsoft-365/solutions/architecture-icons-templates?view=o365-worldwide). This Visio stencil set includes many conceptual icons, including many security symbols. 

To download Azure icons, see [Azure architecture icons](/azure/architecture/icons/).

With both of these icon sets, you can download just the SVG files (scalable vector graphic). You can drag and drop these icon files into any tool, including Visio and PowerPoint.

### Zero Trust architecture illustrations
These illustrations are replicas of the reference illustrations across the Zero Trust guidance center. Download and customize these for your own organization or customer.
