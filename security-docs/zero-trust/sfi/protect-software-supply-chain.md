title: Protect the software supply chain (Secure Future Initiative) – Zero Trust
description: Secure all tenants and their resources is part of the Protect engineering systems pillar of the Secure Future Initiative (SFI), which focuses on reducing attack surfaces and lateral movement risk by enforcing strict tenant governance, modernizing platform dependencies, and isolating production access. It emphasizes Zero Trust by default, ensuring that every tenant, system, and user operates under minimum necessary access and hardened boundaries.

# Protect the software supply chain (Secure Future Initiative)

**Pillar name: Protect engineering systems**<br />
**Pattern name: Protect the software supply chain**

Microsoft has strengthened its software supply chain by implementing automated vulnerability scanning, a centralized malware-blocking feed, and standardized pipeline templates to enforce security policies. These measures ensure rapid, consistent updates and protect against malicious components entering production.

## Context and problem

Modern software development depends on complex supply chains that include open-source software (OSS), internal packages, build pipelines, and release automation. While these accelerate innovation, they also expand the attack surface. Adversaries can target vulnerable OSS dependencies, inject malware through public feeds, or exploit gaps in build and release pipelines.

Microsoft's scale amplifies this challenge: more than **78,000 Azure DevOps (AzDO) pipelines** run monthly, and thousands of repositories rely on OSS components. Historically, teams had broad flexibility in how pipelines were configured. This created fragmentation, slowed adoption of new security policies, and introduced potential vulnerabilities.

To reduce this risk, Microsoft made protecting the software supply chain a core priority under the Secure Future Initiative (SFI).

## Solution

Microsoft deployed a **defense-in-depth** approach for securing its software supply chain, combining governance, automation, and Zero Trust architecture:

- **Component Governance (CG):** Software Composition Analysis (SCA) automatically enabled across engineering systems to identify vulnerabilities in OSS dependencies.  
- **Centralized Feed Service (CFS):** An internal feed that blocks malware, scans for viruses, detects typosquatting, and quarantines new package versions before allowing ingestion into production repositories.  
- **Governed Pipeline Templates:** Standardized YAML templates enforce secure compute, inject required static analysis tools, enable SBOM generation, and apply compliance gates such as two-person pull request sign-off and code signing.  
- **Centralized updates:** Centralized mechanisms push compliance and security updates to all pipelines, ensuring rapid, consistent adoption of new requirements.  

Together, these measures protect Microsoft's engineering systems from OSS supply chain attacks, enable enterprise-wide SBOM compliance, and reduce the risk of malicious or vulnerable components entering production.  

## Guidance
Organizations can adopt a similar pattern using the following actionable practices:


| **Use case** | **Recommended action** | **Resource** |
|---------------|------------------------|----------------|
| OSS ingestion control | - Use centralized feeds to govern all package consumption, blocking public feeds in production. | [Safeguard against malicious public packages – Azure Artifacts](/azure/devops/artifacts/concepts/upstream-behavior) |
| Vulnerability detection | - Enable Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to track dependencies and automatically flag high-severity vulnerabilities. | [Explore Software Composition Analysis (SCA) – Microsoft Learn](/training/modules/software-composition-analysis/3-explore-software-composition-analysis) |
| Pipeline security enforcement | - Adopt governed pipeline templates that inject static analysis, compliance checks, and SBOM generation.<br>- Configure the Microsoft Security DevOps Azure DevOps extension.<br>- Install Microsoft’s open-source SBOM generation tool. | [YAML pipeline templates](/azure/devops/pipelines/process/templates)<br>[Azure Artifacts](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/devops/artifacts)<br>[Configure the Microsoft Security DevOps Azure DevOps extension – Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/defender-for-cloud/azure-devops-extension)<br>[GitHub SBOM tool](https://github.com/microsoft/sbom-tool) |
| Policy rollout at scale | - Use centrally managed templates (extends model) to enforce new security and compliance requirements across thousands of pipelines. | [Pipeline governance with templates](/azure/devops/pipelines/process/templates/) |
| Audit and monitoring | - Continuously monitor pipelines to ensure template usage and review compliance quarterly. | [Azure DevOps auditing](/azure/devops/organizations/audit/azure-devops-auditing) |


## Benefits 
- **Reduced OSS risk:** Prevents ingestion of malicious or vulnerable open-source packages.  
- **Standardized compliance:** Provides consistent enforcement of SBOMs, static analysis, and code-signing requirements.  
- **Scalable policy adoption:** Central governance enables rapid rollout of new security standards across 75k+ pipelines.  
- **Improved productivity:** Templates accelerate setup for new teams, reducing duplication and errors.  
- **Audit readiness:** Centralized logging and SBOM evidence simplify regulatory and customer compliance reporting.  


## Trade-offs 
- **Developer friction:** Teams may experience delays when quarantined OSS packages or policy checks block builds.  
- **Operational overhead:** Central feeds and templates require continuous maintenance, tuning, and support.  
- **Version adoption lag:** Security validation may delay the use of the latest OSS versions in production.  
- **Customization limits:** Teams must balance local needs with centrally enforced requirements, requiring compromise.  

## Key success factors

To track success, measure the following:

- **Pipeline adoption rate:** Percentage of CI/CD pipelines using governed templates.  
- **OSS governance coverage:** Percentage of production repositories consuming OSS only through the Centralized Feed Service (CFS).  
- **SBOM compliance:** Proportion of builds generating SBOMs automatically.  
- **Vulnerability reduction:** Decline in unresolved high/critical OSS vulnerabilities in production.  
- **Audit consistency:** Frequency and accuracy of compliance reviews across active pipelines.   

## Summary

Protecting the software supply chain requires both technical enforcement and operational discipline. Microsoft is addressing this by combining Component Governance, a Centralized Feed Service, and Governed Pipeline Templates to help secure every stage of the software lifecycle. These measures assist with safeguarding against OSS vulnerabilities, enforce compliance with SBOM requirements, and provide scalable, automated protection across tens of thousands of pipelines.

Organizations can adopt similar practices: centralize package ingestion, enforce SBOM and compliance checks through governed pipeline templates, and continuously monitor usage to adapt to new security threats.

**Strengthen security from code to production to better protect your software supply chain with centralized feeds, automated analysis, and governed pipelines.**
