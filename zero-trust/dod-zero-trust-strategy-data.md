# DoD Zero Trust Strategy for the data pillar

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Zero Trust Portfolio Management Office (ZT PfMO) was established to orchestrate DoD-wide Zero Trust adoption and execution. In November 2022, the DoD ZT PfMO released the [DoD Zero Trust Strategy and Roadmap](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3225919/department-of-defense-releases-zero-trust-strategy-and-roadmap/). 

The strategy and accompanying execution plans outline a path to adopt a new cybersecurity framework to facilitate well-informed, risk-based decisions. This model incorporates Zero Trust principles by eliminating traditional perimeters and trust assumptions, enabling a more efficient architecture that enhances security, user experience, and mission performance. The Zero Trust Framework aims to minimize DoD attack surface, reduce risks, enable effective data-sharing and collaboration, proactively safeguard its technical estate, and disrupt adversarial activities.

The DoD Zero Trust Strategy covers seven pillars representing protection areas for Zero Trust. Use the following links to go to sections of the guide. 

* 1 User
* 2 Device
* 3 Applications and workloads
* 4 Data
* 5 Network
* 6 Automation and orchestration
* 7 Visibility and analytics

### 4.7 Data access control

Microsoft 365 and Azure Storage services are integrated with Microsoft Entra ID for identity-based authorization. Microsoft Entra ID supports role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC).

Microsoft Entra roles and security groups provide organizations role-based access control. Dynamic security groups use attributes defined on user, group, and device objects to define membership, based upon rich expressions and rule sets.

Microsoft Entra ID attribute-based access control utilizes custom security attributes, which are business-specific attributes you can define and assign to Microsoft Entra objects. Custom security attributes store sensitive information. Access to view, or modify, custom security attributes is restricted to Attribute Administrator roles.
