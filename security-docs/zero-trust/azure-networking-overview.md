# Overview â€“ Apply Zero Trust principles to Azure networking

This series of articles help you apply the principles of Zero Trust to your networking infrastructure in Microsoft Azure based on a multi-disciplinary approach to applying the Zero Trust principles. Zero Trust is a security strategy. It isn't a product or a service, but an approach in designing and implementing the following set of security principles:

- Verify explicitly
- Use least privileged access
- Assume breach

Implementing the Zero Trust mindset to "assume breach, never trust, always verify" requires changes to cloud networking infrastructure, deployment strategy, and implementation.

The following articles show you how to apply Zero Trust approach to networking for commonly deployed Azure infrastructure services:

- [Encryption](azure-networking-encryption.md)
- [Segmentation](azure-networking-segmentation.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This Zero Trust guidance describes how to use and configure several security solutions and features available on Azure for a reference architecture. Several other resources also provide security guidance for these solutions and features, including:

> - [Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark](/security/benchmark/azure/introduction)
> - [Microsoft Cloud Security Baseline](/security/benchmark/azure/security-baselines-overview)

To describe how to apply a Zero Trust approach, this guidance targets a common pattern used in production by many organizations: a virtual-machine-based application hosted in a VNet (and IaaS application). This is a common pattern for organizations migrating on-premises applications to Azure, which is sometimes referred to as "lift-and-shift."

## Threat Protection with Microsoft Defender for Cloud

**Microsoft Defender for Cloud** is an extended detection and response (XDR) solution that automatically collects, correlates, and analyzes signal, threat, and alert data from across your environment. Defender for Cloud is intended to be used together with Microsoft Defender XDR to provide a greater breadth of correlated protection of your environment, as shown in the following diagram.

:::image type="content" source="media/azure-infra-overview/azure-infra-overview-threat-protection.svg" alt-text="The logical architecture of Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Defender XDR that provides threat protection for Azure IaaS components." lightbox="media/azure-infra-overview/azure-infra-overview-threat-protection.svg":::

In the diagram:

- Defender for Cloud is enabled for a management group that includes multiple Azure subscriptions.
- Microsoft Defender XDR is enabled for Microsoft 365 apps and data, SaaS apps that are integrated with Microsoft Entra ID, and on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) servers.

For more information about configuring management groups and enabling Defender for Cloud, see:

- [Organize subscriptions into management groups and assign roles to users](/azure/defender-for-cloud/management-groups-roles)
- [Enable Defender for Cloud on all subscriptions in a management group](/azure/defender-for-cloud/onboard-management-group)

## Security solutions in this series of articles

Zero Trust involves applying multiple disciplines of security and information protection together. In this series of articles, this multi-discipline approach is applied to each of the units of work for infrastructure components as follows:

**[Apply Zero Trust principles to Azure storage](azure-infrastructure-storage.md)**

1. Protect data in all three modes: data at rest, data in transit, and data in use
1. Verify users and control access to storage data with the least privileges
1. Logically separate or segregate critical data with network controls
1. Use Defender for Storage for automated threat detection and protection

**[Apply Zero Trust principles to virtual machines in Azure](azure-infrastructure-virtual-machines.md)**

1. Configure logical isolation for virtual machines
1. Leverage Role Based Access Control (RBAC)
1. Secure virtual machine boot components
1. Enable customer-managed keys and double encryption
1. Control the applications installed on virtual machines
1. Configure secure access
1. Set up secure maintenance of virtual machines
1. Enable advanced threat detection and protection

**[Apply Zero Trust principles to a spoke VNet in Azure](azure-infrastructure-iaas.md)**

1. Leverage Microsoft Entra RBAC or set up custom roles for networking resources
1. Isolate infrastructure into its own resource group
1. Create a network security group for each subnet
1. Create an application security group for each virtual machine role
1. Secure traffic and resources within the VNet
1. Secure access to the VNet and application
1. Enable advanced threat detection and protection

**[Apply Zero Trust principles to a hub VNet in Azure](azure-infrastructure-networking.md)**

1. Secure Azure Firewall Premium
1. Deploy Azure DDoS Protection Standard
1. Configure network gateway routing to the firewall
1. Configure threat protection
