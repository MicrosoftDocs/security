# SDL Security Bug Bar (Sample)

**Note:** This sample document is for illustration purposes only. The content presented below outlines basic criteria to consider when creating security processes. It is not an exhaustive list of activities or criteria and should not be treated as such.

Please refer to the [definitions of terms](#Definition_of_Terms) in this section.

<p>Please refer to the <a href="#denial-of-service-server-matrix">Denial of Service Matrix</a> for a complete matrix of server DoS scenarios.</p>
<p>The server bar is usually not appropriate when user interaction is part of the exploitation process. If a Critical vulnerability exists only on server products, and is exploited in a way that requires user interaction and results in the compromise of the server, the severity may be reduced from Critical to Important in accordance with the NEAT/data definition of extensive user interaction presented at the start of the client severity pivot.</p>

<li><p><strong>Clarification:</strong> Note that the effect of extensive user interaction is not one level reduction in severity, but is and has been a reduction in severity in certain circumstances where the phrase extensive user interaction appears in the bug bar.

This bug bar does not allow you to reduce the Elevation of Privilege below Important because of user interaction.</p></li>

<span id="Definition_of_Terms" class="anchor"></span>
## Definition of Terms  
**authenticated**  
Any attack which has to include authenticating by the network. This
implies that logging of some type must be able to occur so that the
attacker can be identified.  

**anonymous**  
Any attack which does not need to authenticate to complete.  

**client**  
Either software that runs locally on a single computer or software that
accesses shared resources provided by a server over a network.  

**default/common**  
Any features that are active out of the box or that reach more than 10
percent of users.  

**scenario**  
Any features that require special customization or use cases to enable,
reaching less than 10 percent of users.  

**server**  
Computer that is configured to run software that awaits and fulfills
requests from client processes that run on other computers.  

**Critical**  
A security vulnerability that would be rated as
having the highest potential for damage.

**Important**  
A security vulnerability that would be rated as
having significant potential for damage, but less than Critical.

**Moderate**  
A security vulnerability that would be rated as
having moderate potential for damage, but less than Important.

**Low**  
A security vulnerability that would be rated as having
low potential for damage.

**targeted information disclosure**  
Ability to intentionally select (target) desired information.  

**temporary DoS**  
A temporary DoS is a situation where the following criteria are met:

  - The target cannot perform normal operations due to an attack.

  - The response to an attack is roughly the same magnitude as the size
    of the attack.

  - The target returns to the normal level of functionality shortly
    after the attack is finished. The exact definition of "shortly"
    should be evaluated for each product.

For example, a server is unresponsive while an attacker is constantly
sending a stream of packets across a network, and the server returns to
normal a few seconds after the packet stream stops.

**temporary DoS with amplification**

A temporary DoS with amplification is a situation where the following
criteria are met:

  - The target cannot perform normal operations due to an attack.

  - The response to an attack is magnitudes beyond the size of the
    attack.

  - The target returns to the normal level of functionality after the
    attack is finished, but it takes some time (perhaps a few minutes).

For example, if you can send a malicious 10-byte packet and cause a
2048k response on the network, you are DoSing the bandwidth by
amplifying our attack effort.

**permanent DoS**

A permanent DoS is one that requires an administrator to start, restart,
or reinstall all or parts of the system. Any vulnerability that
automatically restarts the system is also a permanent
DoS.
