>[!NOTE]
> * As part of this release, Microsoft also updated the Untrusted CTL time stamp and sequence number. No changes were made to the contents of the Untrusted CTL but this will cause your system to download/refresh the Untrusted CTL. This is a normal update that is sometimes done when the Trusted Root CTL is updated.
> * The update package will be available for download and testing at: <https://aka.ms/CTLDownload>
> * Signatures on the Certificate Trust Lists (CTLs) for the Microsoft Trusted Root Program changed from dual-signed (SHA-1/SHA-2) to SHA-2 only. No customer action required.
