# Zero Trust assessment and progress tracking resources

[Zero Trust](./zero-trust-overview.md) is a new security model that assumes breach and verifies each request as though it originated from an uncontrolled network. Regardless of where the request originates or what resource it accesses, the Zero Trust model teaches us to "never trust, always verify."

As an IT architect or implementer, you can use the assessment and progress tracking resources in this article to:

- Assess your infrastructure’s readiness for Zero Trust, including discovering which elements are already in place or can be easily strengthened or improved.
- Track the progress of the necessary Zero Trust security improvements in your environment for both business leaders and your IT departments.

## Progress tracking resources for the adoption framework business scenarios

The Zero Trust adoption framework documentation set helps security and technology teams collaborate with business leaders on Zero Trust by providing:

- Recommended Zero Trust objectives for business leaders across organizations.
- A methodical and phased approach to implementing a Zero Trust architecture.
- A systematic way to track progress on objectives, scoped to business leaders.
- A systematic way to track progress on objectives and their tasks, scoped to IT leads and implementers.
- Curation of the most relevant resources for adoption of Zero Trust including:

  - PowerPoint slides that are ready to present to business leaders.
  - Excel worksheets to assess your current status and to track progress.
  - Technical implementation guidance and user infographics.

This Zero Trust adoption guidance recommends building a Zero Trust strategy and architecture through these business scenarios:

- [Rapidly modernize your security posture](./adopt/rapidly-modernize-security-posture.md)
- [Secure remote and hybrid work](./adopt/secure-remote-hybrid-work.md)
- [Identify and protect sensitive business data](./adopt/identify-protect-sensitive-business-data.md)
- [Prevent or reduce business damage from a breach](./adopt/prevent-reduce-business-damage-breach.md)
- [Meet regulatory and compliance requirements](./adopt/meet-regulatory-compliance-requirements.md)

Each business scenario describes how to advance the required technical work through each of the lifecycle phases (Define strategy, Plan, Ready, Adopt, and Govern and manage), starting with building the business case.

For each business scenario, you can use the following progress tracking resources.
