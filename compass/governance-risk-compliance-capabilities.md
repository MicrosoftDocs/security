|Management Groups     | If your organization has many subscriptions, you may need a way to efficiently manage access, policies, and compliance for those subscriptions. Azure management groups provide a level of scope above subscriptions. You organize subscriptions into containers called "management groups" and apply your governance conditions to the management groups.        |[Organize your resources with Azure management groups ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/management-groups/overview)        |
|Azure Policy     |Azure Policy is a service in Azure that you use to create, assign, and manage policies. These policies enforce different rules and effects over your resources, so those resources stay compliant with your corporate standards and service level agreements.         |  [Azure Policy documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/)       |
|Azure Blueprints    | Azure Blueprints enables cloud architects and central information technology groups to define a repeatable set of Azure resources that implements and adheres to an organization's standards, patterns, and requirements. Azure Blueprints makes it possible for development teams to rapidly build and stand up new environments with trust they're building within organizational compliance with a set of built-in components -- such as networking -- to speed up development and delivery.       |   [Azure Blueprints documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/blueprints/overview)      |
