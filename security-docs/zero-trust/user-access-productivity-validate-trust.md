This Rapid Modernization Plan (RaMP) checklist helps you establish a security perimeter for cloud applications and mobile devices that uses identity as the control plane and explicitly validates trust for user accounts and devices before allowing access, for both public and private networks.

To be productive, your employees (users) must be able to use:

- Their account credentials to verify their identity.
- Their endpoint (device), such as a PC, tablet, or phone.
- The applications you have provided them to do their jobs.
- A network over which traffic flows between devices and applications, whether they are on premises or in the cloud.

Each one of these elements are the targets of attackers and must be protected with the "never trust, always verify" central principle of Zero Trust.

This checklist includes using Zero Trust to explicitly validate trust for all access requests for:

- [Identities](#identities)
- [Endpoints (devices)](#endpoints)
- [Apps](#apps)
- [Network](#network)

After completing this work, you will have built out this part of the Zero Trust architecture.

## Identities

Verify and secure each identity with strong authentication across your entire digital estate with Microsoft Entra ID, a complete identity and access management solution with integrated security that connects hundreds of millions of people to their apps, devices, and data each month.

## Apps

Because apps are used by malicious users to infiltrate your organization, you need to ensure that your apps are using services, such as Microsoft Entra ID and Intune, that provide Zero Trust protection or are hardened against attack.

### Program and project member accountabilities

This table describes a Zero Trust implementation for apps in terms of a sponsorship/program management/project management hierarchy to determine and drive results.

| Lead | Owner | Accountability |
|:-------|:-------|:-----|
|  CISO, CIO, or Director of Application Security | | Executive sponsorship |
| Program lead from Apps Management| | Drive results and cross-team collaboration |
| | Identity Architect  | Advise on Microsoft Entra configuration for apps <br> Update authentication standards for on-premises apps |
| | Developer Architect  | Advise on configuration and standards for in-house on-premises and cloud apps |
| | Network Architect | Implement VPN configuration changes |
| | Cloud Network Architect | Deploy Microsoft Entra application proxy |
| | Security Governance | Monitor to ensure compliance |

### Deployment objectives

Meet these deployment objectives to ensure Zero Trust protection for your Microsoft cloud apps, third-party SaaS apps, custom PaaS apps, and on-premises apps.

| Done | Type of app or app usage | Deployment objectives | Owner | Documentation |
|:-------|:-------|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| <input type="checkbox" /> | Third-party SaaS apps and custom PaaS apps that are registered with Microsoft Entra ID | Microsoft Entra app registration uses Microsoft Entra authentication, certification, and app consent policies. <br><br>  Use Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policies and Intune MAM and Application Protection Policies (APP) policies to allow app usage. | Identity Architect | [Application management in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/what-is-application-management)  |
| <input type="checkbox" /> | Cloud apps that are OAuth-enabled and registered in Microsoft Entra ID, Google, and Salesforce | Use app governance in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps for app behavior visibility, governance with policy enforcement, and detection and remediation of app-based attacks. | Security Engineer | [Overview](/defender-cloud-apps/app-governance-manage-app-governance) |
| <input type="checkbox" /> | Third-party SaaS apps and custom PaaS apps that are **NOT** registered with Microsoft Entra ID | Register them with Microsoft Entra ID for authentication, certification, and app consent policies. <br><br>  Use Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policies and Intune MAM and APP policies. | Apps Architect | [Integrating all your apps with Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/fundamentals/five-steps-to-full-application-integration) |
| <input type="checkbox" /> | On-premises users accessing on-premises applications, which includes applications running on both on-premises and IaaS-based servers | Ensure that your apps support modern authentication protocols such as OAuth/OIDC and SAML. Contact your application vendor for updates to protect user sign-in. | Identity Architect | See your vendor documentation |
| <input type="checkbox" /> | Remote users accessing on-premises applications through a VPN connection | Configure your VPN appliance so that it uses Microsoft Entra ID as its identity provider | Network Architect | See your vendor documentation |
| <input type="checkbox" /> | Remote users accessing on-premises **web** applications through a VPN connection | Publish the applications through Microsoft Entra application proxy. Remote users only need to access the individual published application, which is routed to the on-premises web server through an application proxy connector. <br><br> Connections take advantage of strong Microsoft Entra authentication and limits users and their devices to accessing a single application at a time. In contrast, the scope of a typical remote access VPN is all locations, protocols, and ports of the entire on-premises network. | Cloud Network Architect | [Remote access to on-premises applications through Microsoft Entra application proxy](/entra/identity/app-proxy/application-proxy) |


After completing these deployment objectives, you will have built out the **Apps** section of the Zero Trust architecture.

## Network

The Zero Trust model assumes breach and verifies each request as though it originated from an uncontrolled network. Although this is a common practice for public networks, it also applies to your organization’s internal networks which are generally firewalled from the public Internet.

To adhere to Zero Trust, your organization must address security vulnerabilities on both public and private networks, whether on-premises or in the cloud, and ensure that you verify explicitly, use least privilege access, and assume breach. Devices, users, and apps are not to be inherently trusted because they are on your private networks.
