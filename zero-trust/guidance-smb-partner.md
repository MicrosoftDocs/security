# Small Business Zero Trust guidance

This article describes Zero Trust deployment guidance and resources for customers and partners working with Microsoft’s small business plans and other technologies commonly used by small business customers.  These resources help you realize the principles of Zero Trust:

- Verify explicitly – authenticate and authorize with identify and device access policies.
- Use least-privilege access – provide users with only the access they need and for the time they need it to perform their tasks.
- Assume breach – do what you can to prevent attacks, protect against threats, and then be ready to respond.

This article also includes information and resources for Microsoft partners.

## Configuration guidance for Microsoft 365 Business Premium

This guidance applies the principles of Zero Trust in an end-to-end configuration process using the capabilities provided in Microsoft Business Premium.
