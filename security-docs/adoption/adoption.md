# Security Adoption Resources

Navigating the continuously changing threat landscape, technology platforms, and business requirements is often challenging for many organizations.

The Security Adoption Framework (SAF) provides guidance for organizations through end-to-end security modernization across a 'hybrid of everything' multicloud and multi-platform technical estate.

Each element of this guidance can be used individually or as part of holistic end-to-end security modernization from a strategic and programmatic level through architectural and technical planning.

This guidance applies Zero Trust principles to all aspects of end-to-end security modernization.

## Objectives

**End-to-end security approach** - The Security Adoption Framework enables executive leaders, architects, and technical practitioners to build and execute an integrated strategy and architecture that aligns security to your organization through business, security, and technical platform needs.

**Agile security** - Provides flexibility to adapt to the continuously evolving attacks, changing business requirements, and technology platform changes you face today.

**Practical and pragmatic** - Each stakeholder has guidance to help them understand and execute this security modernization including:

- Best practices
- Lessons learned
- References based on real world examples

Meeting these objectives allows organizations to accelerate business enablement and security risk reduction.

## How to consume the guidance

In addition to these publicly available elements, Microsoft also offers these and other workshops as expert led engagements for Microsoft Unified customers

### Microsoft led workshops

You might choose to have Microsoft experts lead workshops with your team to help accelerate your planning and execution of security modernization. These workshops guide your organization through any or all of the security adoption framework elements as well as technical deployment and optimization of Microsoft security technology.

These engagements range from a few hours to several days of deep planning, as described in the following section.

## Microsoft Unified engagements

The Microsoft Unified Security Adoption Framework engagements include the following items:

| Use case | Title and description | Topic summary | Full workshop |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Getting Started** <br> _(Start here if you don't know where to start)_| **Overview and Scoping** - This short conversation is like a 'trail headâ€™ to help you pick the best path to get started with security modernization planning based on your current needs and priorities. | Four hours | - |
| **Product Adoption** | **Security Capability Adoption Planning** helps you maximize value from your current product licenses and entitlements by providing an overview of these Microsoft product capabilities. This session includes a prioritization and planning exercise to rapidly get the most security benefit out of the capabilities you have access to. This overview often includes Microsoft 365 E5 and Microsoft Unified. | - | Two days |
| **End to End Technical Architecture** |**Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architectures (MCRA)** provide guidance on end to end technical architectures including a summary of Microsoft security capabilities, integration, and more. Based on aka.ms/MCRA. The **Security Architecture Design Session (ADS) Module 1** guides you through more architectural context including: guiding principles, a 'Rosetta Stone' of security models, cross-discipline integrated scenarios, shared responsibility models, technical plans, and more. | Four hours <br> (MCRA) | Two Days <br> (Security ADS 1) |
| **Strategy and Program** | **The CISO Workshop** enables senior security and technology leaders to accelerate security strategy and program modernization with best practices and lessons learned.
