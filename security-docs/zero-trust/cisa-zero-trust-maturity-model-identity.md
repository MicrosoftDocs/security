# CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model for the identity pillar

A unified identity provider (IdP) is crucial to manage access effectively; it ensures users and entities have the right access to resources without excessive permissions. Integrating identity, credential, and access management solutions create strong authentication, tailored context-based authorization, and identity risk assessment. 

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) [Memorandum-22-09](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf), released in support of [Executive Order 14028: Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity](https://www.gsa.gov/technology/it-contract-vehicles-and-purchasing-programs/information-technology-category/it-security/executive-order-14028), mandates federal agencies employ centralized identity management systems for their users. These systems can integrate into applications and common platforms, ensuring a unified approach to identity management. This requirement is part of the Zero Trust strategy that enhances cybersecurity and data privacy. We recommend consolidation of IdPs, identity stores, and identity management systems by adopting [Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity) as the IdP.

## 1 Identity

This section has Microsoft guidance and recommendations for the [CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model](https://www.cisa.gov/zero-trust-maturity-model) in the identity pillar. The Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) identifies identity as an attribute, or attribute set, which uniquely describes an agency user or entity, including nonperson entities. To learn more, see [Securing identity with Zero Trust](/security/zero-trust/deploy/identity). 

## 1.1 Function: Authentication

|**CISA ZTMM Stage Description**|**Microsoft guidance and recommendations**|
|---|--|
|**Initial Maturity Status**</br></br>Enterprise authenticates identity using MFA, which may include passwords as one factor and requires validation of multiple entity attributes (e.g., locale or activity).  |**Microsoft Entra ID**</br> Establish an identity foundation by consolidating identity providers, putting [Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/fundamentals/whatis) in the path of every access request. While you identify and migrate applications to Microsoft Entra ID, implement policy that mandates new applications integrate with Microsoft Entra ID. This action ensures security policies, such as multifactor authentication (MFA) and entity attribute validation, are applied consistently for access to Enterprise resources. Throughout 2024-2025 Microsoft is rolling out MFA enforcement for admin portals. Microsoft recommends accounts use MFA.</br> - [Migrate apps and authentication to Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/architecture/migration-best-practices) </br> - [Mandatory Microsoft Entra MFA](/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mandatory-multifactor-authentication) </br> - [Secure identity with Zero Trust](/security/zero-trust/deploy/identity) </br></br> **Microsoft Entra authentication methods**</br> Enable enterprise-allowed MFA methods with policy settings in Microsoft Entra.
