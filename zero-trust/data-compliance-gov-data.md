# Step 3. Data

Your on-premises and cloud data must be protected from both inadvertent and malicious access. 

- Inadvertent access occurs when a user gains access to data that, based on their roles and responsibilities, they should not have. The result can be unintended data leakage, data destruction, or violations of data security and privacy regulations.

- Malicious access occurs when an external attacker or a malicious insider intentionally tries to access data. Malicious insiders can use your data for profit or to harm your organization. External attackers can delete, alter, exfiltrate, and encrypt your most sensitive data, leaving you open to a ransomware attack.

For both types of attacks, you must take the necessary steps to identify your data, protect it, prevent its destruction or exfiltration, and ensure that only users with a business purpose have access to it.

Protecting your data is part of the "assume breach" Zero Trust principle. Even with all the user account and device protections in place, you must assume that an attacker could find their way in and begin traversing your environment, searching for the most valuable data for your organization.

Therefore, you must:

- Know your data

  Understand your data landscape and identify important information across your cloud and on-premises environment.

- Protect your data

  Protect your sensitive data throughout its lifecycle by applying sensitivity labels linked to protection actions like encryption, access restrictions, visual markings, and more.

- Prevent data loss

  Apply a consistent set of data loss prevention policies across the cloud, on-premises environments, and endpoints to monitor, prevent, and remediate risky activities with sensitive data.

- Use least privilege access

  Apply minimal permissions consisting of who is allowed to access and what they are allowed to do with data to meet business and productivity requirements.

## Program and project member accountabilities

This table describes the overall protection of your organization data in terms of a sponsorship/program management/project management hierarchy to determine and drive results.
