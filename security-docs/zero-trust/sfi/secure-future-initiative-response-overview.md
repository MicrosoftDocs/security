# Overview - Accelerate response and remediation

The [Secure Future Initiative (SFI) initiative](secure-future-initiative-overview.md) is a multiyear, cross-Microsoft initiative to increasingly secure the way in which Microsoft designs, builds, tests, and operates its products and services. SFI is build upon:

- A set of security principles that drive the way in which we innovate on security design, implement those innovations into Microsoft products as secure defaults and standards, and provide internal and external security guidance. [Learn more](secure-future-initiative-overview.md#security-principles).
- A set of prioritized security pillars and objectives. [Learn more](secure-future-initiative-overview.md#sfi-pillars-zero-trust-and-nist).

This article summarizes the "Accelerate response and remediation" SFI pillar.

## Before you start

- [Learn about](secure-future-initiative-overview.md#sfi-pillars-zero-trust-and-nist) the SFI pillars.
- [Review and track the latest progress on pillar objectives](secure-future-initiative-whats-new.md#progress-on-pillar-objectives) in the SFI What's New article.
- Pillar objectives map to [Zero Trust principles](zero-trust/zero-trust-overview), and to  [NIST CSF functions and categories](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.29.pdf).
- [Get a list of NIST categories and acronyms}(secure-future-initiative-overview.md#nist-functions) to help as you review the table.


## Pillar and objectives 

The aim of this pillar is to quickly contain threats, restore trust, and improve resilience. It aims to minimize the impact and duration of security events and attacker dwell time in internal networks.


Microsoft objectives for this pillar are summarized in the following table. 

**Objective** | **Details**
--- | ---
**1. Accelerate vulnerability mitigation** | Reduce "Time to Mitigation" for high-severity cloud security vulnerabilities with accelerated response.
**2. Transparency of cloud vulnerabilities** | Increase transparency of mitigated cloud vulnerabilities with the adoption and release of Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) industry standards. Release high severity Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) affecting the cloud.
**3. Enhance public messaging and engagement** | Improve the accuracy, effectiveness, transparency, and velocity of public messaging and customer engagement.
