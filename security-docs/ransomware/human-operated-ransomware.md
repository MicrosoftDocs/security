# What is ransomware?

In practice, a *ransomware attack* blocks access to your data until a ransom is paid.

In fact, ransomware is a type of malware or phishing cyber security attack that destroys or encrypts files and folders on a computer, server, or device.

Once devices or files are locked or encrypted, cybercriminals can extort money from the business or device owner in exchange for a *key* to unlock the encrypted data. But, even when paid, cybercriminals *may never* give the key to the business or device owner, and stop access *permanently*.


## How do ransomware attacks work?

Ransomware can be automated, or involve human hands on a keyboard--a *human operated* attack.

### Automated ransomware attacks

*Commodity ransomware attacks* are often automated. These cyber attacks can spread like a virus, infect devices through methods like email phishing and malware delivery, and require malware remediation.

That means one ransomware prevention technique is to safeguard your email system with 
[Microsoft Defender for Office 365](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/) that protects against malware and phishing delivery. [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/) works alongside Defender for Office 365 to automatically detect and block suspicious activity on your devices, while [Microsoft Defender XDR](/microsoft-365/security/defender/) detects malware and phishing attempts *early*.

### Human-operated ransomware attacks

*Human-operated ransomware* is the result of an **active attack** by cybercriminals that infiltrate an organization's on-premises or cloud IT infrastructure, elevate their privileges, and deploy ransomware to critical data.

These "hands-on-keyboard" attacks usually target organizations rather than a single device.

*Human-operated* also means there's a human attacker using their insights into common system and security misconfigurations. The goal is to infiltrate the organization, navigate the network, and adapt to the environment and its weaknesses.

Hallmarks of these human-operated ransomware attacks typically include **credential theft** and **lateral movement** with an elevation of the privileges in stolen accounts.

Activities might take place during maintenance windows and involve security configuration gaps discovered by cybercriminals. The goal is the **deployment of a ransomware payload** to whatever *high business impact resources* the attackers choose.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These attacks can be *catastrophic* to business operations and are difficult to clean up, requiring complete adversary eviction to protect against future attacks. Unlike commodity ransomware that usually only requires malware remediation, **human-operated ransomware will continue to threaten your business operations after the initial encounter**.

This graphic shows how extortion-based attacks are growing in impact and likelihood.

## Ransomware protection for your organization

First, prevent phishing and malware delivery with [Microsoft Defender for Office 365](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/) to protect against malware and phishing delivery, [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/) to automatically detect and block suspicious activity on your devices, and [Microsoft Defender XDR](/microsoft-365/security/defender/) to detect to malware and phishing attempts *early*.

For a comprehensive view of ransomware and extortion and how to protect your organization, use the information in the **[Human-Operated Ransomware Mitigation Project Plan](https://download.microsoft.com/download/7/5/1/751682ca-5aae-405b-afa0-e4832138e436/RansomwareRecommendations.pptx)** PowerPoint presentation. 

Here's a summary of the guidance:

[The summary of the guidance in the Human-Operated Ransomware Mitigation Project Plan](media/human-operated-ransomware/stakes-weaknesses-plan.png)

- The stakes of ransomware and extortion-based attacks are high.
- However, the attacks have weaknesses that can reduce your likelihood of being attacked.
- There are three steps to configuring your infrastructure to exploit attack weaknesses.

For the three steps to exploit attack weaknesses, see the [Protect your organization against ransomware and extortion](protect-against-ransomware.md) solution to **quickly** configure your IT infrastructure for the best protection:

1. Prepare your organization to recover from an attack without having to pay the ransom.
2. Limit the scope of damage of a ransomware attack by protecting privileged roles.
3. Make it harder for an attacker to get into your environment by incrementally removing risks.
