# What is Zero Trust?

<!---

Zero Trust is a security strategy. It is not a product or a service, but an approach in designing and implementing the following set of security principles.

| Principle | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Verify explicitly | Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points. |
| Use least privilege access | Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection. |
| Assume breach | Minimize blast radius and segment access. Verify end-to-end encryption and use analytics to get visibility, drive threat detection, and improve defenses. |

This is the core of **Zero Trust**. Instead of believing everything behind the corporate firewall is safe, the Zero Trust model assumes breach and verifies each request as though it originated from an uncontrolled network. Regardless of where the request originates or what resource it accesses, the Zero Trust model teaches us to "never trust, always verify."

Zero Trust is designed to adapt to the complexities of the modern environment that embraces the mobile workforce and protects user accounts, devices, applications, and data wherever they are located.

A Zero Trust approach should extend throughout the entire digital estate and serve as an integrated security philosophy and end-to-end strategy.

Different organizational requirements, existing technology implementations, and security stages all affect how a Zero Trust security model implementation is planned and executed. Using our experience in helping customers to secure their organizations, as well as in implementing our own Zero Trust model, Microsoft has developed guidance to assess your readiness and help you build a plan to get to Zero Trust.

With Zero Trust, you move away from a trust-by-default perspective to a trust-by-exception one. An integrated capability to automatically manage those exceptions and alerts is important so you can more easily find and detect threats, respond to them, and prevent or block undesired events across your organization.

## Zero Trust and the US Executive Order 14028 on Cybersecurity

[US executive order 14028, Improving the Nation's Cyber Security](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity), directs federal agencies on advancing security measures that drastically reduce the risk of successful cyberattacks against the federal government's digital infrastructure. On January 26, 2022, the [Office of Management and Budget (OMB)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/) released the federal Zero Trust strategy in [memorandum 22-09](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf), in support of EO 14028.

## Zero Trust for Microsoft 365

Microsoft 365 is built intentionally with many security and information protection capabilities to help you build Zero Trust into your environment. Many of the capabilities can be extended to protect access to other SaaS apps your organization uses and the data within these apps.

See these key resources to get started:

- [Zero Trust deployment plan with Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/security/microsoft-365-zero-trust)
- [The Microsoft Zero Trust security model setup guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2222968)
- [Advanced deployment guide for Zero Trust with Microsoft 365 (requires sign-in)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2224820) in the Microsoft 365 admin center

## Zero Trust for Microsoft Azure

These articles help you apply the principles of Zero Trust to your workloads and services in Microsoft Azure based on a multi-disciplinary approach to applying the Zero Trust principles.
