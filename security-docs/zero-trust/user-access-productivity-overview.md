# User access and productivity

To be productive, your employees (users) must be able to use:

- Their account credentials to verify their identity.
- Their endpoint (device), such as a PC, tablet, or phone.
- The applications you have provided them to do their jobs. 
- A network over which traffic flows between devices and applications, whether they are on premises or in the cloud.

Each one of these elements are the targets of attackers and must be protected with the "never trust, always verify" central principle of Zero Trust.

## Next step

Begin the user access and productivity initiative with [Step 1. Explicitly validate trust for all access requests](user-access-productivity-validate-trust.md).
