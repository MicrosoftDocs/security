# CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model for the devices pillar

This section has Microsoft guidance and recommendations for the [CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model](https://www.cisa.gov/zero-trust-maturity-model) in the devices pillar.

## 2 Devices

CISA identifies a device as an asset that connects to a network, including servers, desktop and laptop computers, printers, mobiles phones, internet of things (IoT) devices, networking equipment, and more. Assets include hardware software, firmware, etc. To learn more, see [Securing endpoints with Zero Trust](/security/zero-trust/deploy/endpoints).
