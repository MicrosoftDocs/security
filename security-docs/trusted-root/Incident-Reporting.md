# Security Incident Response Requirements - Microsoft Trusted Root Program

## Definitions


1.  "A compromise" means a direct or indirect incident, affecting either the CA , sub-CA, or cross-signed, non-enrolled roots, that results in an actual or potential degradation of the security stature of the PKI, which includes hardware, software, or physical access issues. 

2.  "Security Incident" or "Incident" means any of the following that occur at the CA or a sub-CA:
    1.  A Private Key compromise.
    2.  A mis-issued certificate.
    3.  A known or reasonably knowable, publicly reported compromise.
    4.  Any physical compromise of the CAs infrastructure (e.g. physical access control failure, building compromise, or a failure of the HVAC in the data center).
    5.  Any other issue that Microsoft identifies as calling into question the CA's integrity or trustworthiness.

3.  "Exceptional Circumstance(s)" means an incident(s) in which Microsoft believes that the PKI is compromised as to affect the security posture of a large number of Microsoft's customers.


## CA Responsibilities in the Event of an Incident

All CAs are required to have at least one 24/7-monitored contact or alias meant for incident management. 

In the event of a Security Incident, the CA must:

1.  Notify Microsoft as soon as is practical but no later than 24 hours from the time of  Security Incident discovery by completing the following questions below and sending the completed responses to msroot\@microsoft.com. The form requires the following information (if known at the time):
    -   Who detected the incident.
    -   If available, who perpetrated the incident.
    -   When the CA discovered the incident.
    -   Where the incident occurred.
    -   Which Roots, sub-CAs and the number of end-user certificates that were affected by the incident. 
    -   What the CA believes to be the underlying cause of the incident.
    -   What remedial measures the CA has taken or will take that the CA believes will address the underlying cause of the incident.
    -   Any other information the CA believes to be appropriate.
    -   Any other information Microsoft requested when it responded to the initial notification.
    -   Any information or actions the CA requests Microsoft take to increase security or alleviate pain for the end-users. 

2.  At Microsoft's request, the CA must provide a list of all certificates that were mis-issued as a result of the incident.
3.  At Microsoft's request, the CA must provide Microsoft with periodic reports at an interval specified by Microsoft. If Microsoft does not make a specific request, the CA must provide Microsoft an update every 24 hours until the incident is remediated.

4.  Once the incident has been resolved, the CA must provide a final security incident report to Microsoft that includes:
    -   A list of certificates and domains involved in the breach.
    -   How did the CA detect the incident? If the CA did not detect the breach, who did and why did the CA not detect?
    -   If there was a mismatch in the reports over time, why?
    -   Detailed description of the exploit.
    -   Details about what infrastructure was compromised.
    -   Details about how the infrastructure was compromised.
    -   A detailed timeline of events.
    -   The CA's interpretation of who perpetrated the breach.
    -   Was the vulnerability detected by the CAs normal operation? If it was not, please explain why.
    -   Was the vulnerability discovered in the most-recent audit? If yes, then provide information if the vulnerability was remediated. If the vulnerability was not remediated, please provide information about the reason for not doing so.
    -   Was this vulnerability detected by the most-recent audit? If it was not, please explain why.
    -   If the vulnerability was detected in the most recent audit, was it remediated? If not, please explain why.
    -   What changes to the CP/CPS policies will the CA make?
    -   Detailed description of how the issue was closed.

5.  If requested by Microsoft, a complete investigative and technical report of the compromise.

## Microsoft's Rights in the Event of an Incident

In the event of a Security Incident, Microsoft may at its sole discretion, do any of the following:

1.  In an Exceptional Circumstance, immediately remove and/or disallow any certificate the CA or any sub-CA has enrolled in the Program; otherwise, it may remove and/or disallow any certificate after providing seven days' notice to the CA.
2.  Microsoft may take action including, but not limited to, marking files signed by compromised certificates as malware, blocking web navigation to sites served with compromised Server Authentication certificates, etc.
3.  Request that the CA make specific reports at a periodic interval to be determined by Microsoft.
4.  Specify a due date for the CA to submit to Microsoft a final Security Incident report.
5.  Communicate with affected third parties.
6.  Require the CA to employ, at the CA's expense, a third-party investigator to investigate the Security Incident and prepare the final Security Incident report.
7.  Disqualify any Qualifying Audit and require the CA to perform a new Qualifying Audit at the CA's sole expense.

 

## Microsoft's Responsibilities in the Event of a Security Incident

In the event that Microsoft exercises any of the rights described above, Microsoft will:

1.  Notify the CA, in writing, of its intentions 7 days prior to Microsoft's action, except under Exceptional Circumstances, in which case Microsoft will make reasonable efforts to communicate with the CA prior to taking action; and

2.  Allow the CA to propose an alternate course of action, in which case, Microsoft will consider reasonable alternatives but reserves the right to reject such proposals if it deems the proposed course of action not to be in its customers' best interest.
