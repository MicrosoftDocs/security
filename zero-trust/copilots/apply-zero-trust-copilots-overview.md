# Use Zero Trust security to prepare for AI companions, including Microsoft Copilots

Security, especially data protection, is a top concern when introducing AI tools into an organization. Security recommendations for AI are anchored in Zero Trust. As a leader in security, Microsoft provides a practical roadmap and clear guidance for Zero Trust. By implementing recommended protections as you introduce AI tools and companions, you are building a foundation of Zero Trust security. 

This series of articles helps you apply the [principles of Zero Trust](../zero-trust-overview.md) to Microsoftâ€™s Copilots and similar AI companions. Zero Trust is a security strategy. It isn't a product or a service, but an approach in designing and implementing the following set of security principles:

- Verify explicitly
- Use least privileged access
- Assume breach

Implementing the Zero Trust "never trust, always verify" mindset requires changes to cloud infrastructure, deployment strategy, and implementation.

## Layer in protections for AI companions

Microsoft helps you prepare for AI tools and companions and build a Zero Trust foundation at the same time. Take a staged approach starting with protections for web-grounded prompts and maturing to protections for Microsoft 365 graph-grounded prompts. Protections for prompts grounded with data provided by your security tools (Copilot for Security) focus on tuning up least privilege practices and honing threat protection.

In the illustration:
- Web-grounded prompts are issued by Copilot for Bing, Edge, and Windows. Copilot for Microsoft 365 can also be configured to allow web-grounded prompts.
- Microsoft 365-grounded prompts are issued by Copilot for Microsoft 365. If integration with Copilot for Bing, Edge, and Windows is configured, these copilot experiences can include graph-grounded data (for example, when the web/work toggle is set to work).
- Prompts grounded with your security tools are issued by Microsoft Copilot for Security. 

## Get started with Zero Trust by preparing your environment for AI companions

You can build a Zero Trust foundation by preparing your environment for AI companions.

The following table summarizes the illustration and links to articles for implementing the recommended protections.

| Prepare for | Protections | See these Zero Trust articles |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Web-grounded prompts  |User accounts, devices, and some app data.   | [Microsoft Copilot](zero-trust-microsoft-copilot.md)    |
|Microsoft 365 graph-grounded promtps |Includes the previous protections plus more robust protection for app data and cloud apps. It also includes adding in threat protection.  | [Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365](zero-trust-microsoft-365-copilot.md)    |
|Prompts grounded with security tools  |Focuses on tuning up least privilege access, a key principle of Zero Trust.    | [Microsoft Copilot for Security](zero-trust-microsoft-copilot-for-security.md)    |
