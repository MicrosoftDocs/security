# Integrate with Zero Trust solutions

Zero Trust is an approach to security that adapts to the complexity of the modern environment, embraces the mobile workforce, and protects people, devices, applications, and data wherever they are located.

The journey to implementing Zero Trust will be distinct for every organization depending on their needs and existing infrastructure. For this reason, we support technology partner integrations that help meet our customers' unique needs.

The integration guidance in this section is organized by Zero Trust technology areas. This guidance is for software providers and technology partners who want to enhance their security solutions and reach new customers by integrating with Microsoft products.
