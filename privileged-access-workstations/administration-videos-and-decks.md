# Microsoft Security Best Practices module: Privileged administration
Administrative accounts with privileged access to the environment (and associated elements like groups and workstations) must be protected at the highest levels of security assurances to ensure all other security assurances aren't undermined.

See the [Administration](critical-impact-accounts.md) topic for more information.

The following videos provide guidance on administration. You can also download the [PowerPoint slides](/microsoft-365/downloads/security-compass-presentation.pptx) associated with these videos.
