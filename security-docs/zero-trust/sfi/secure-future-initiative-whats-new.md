# What's new in the Secure Future Initiative

The Secure Future Initiative (SFI) initiative is a multiyear, cross-Microsoft initiative to increasingly secure the way in which Microsoft designs, builds, tests, and operates its products and services. 

SFI is build upon:

- A set of security principles that drive innovation on security design, implementation on features, secure defaults, and standards within Microsoft products, and internal and external security guidance. [Learn more](secure-future-initiative-overview.md#security-principles).
- A set of prioritized security pillars and objectives. [Learn more](secure-future-initiative-overview.md#sfi-pillars-zero-trust-and-nist).

This article summarizes our latest progress on innovation, implementation, and guidance, as well as on the pillar objectives.
