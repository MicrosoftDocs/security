# DoD Zero Trust Strategy for the device pillar

The [DoD Zero Trust Strategy and Roadmap](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3225919/department-of-defense-releases-zero-trust-strategy-and-roadmap/) outlines a path for Department of Defense components and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) partners to adopt a new cybersecurity framework based on Zero Trust principles. Zero Trust eliminates traditional perimeters and trust assumptions, enabling a more efficient architecture that enhances security, user experiences, and mission performance. 

This guide has recommendations for the 152 Zero Trust activities in the [DoD Zero Trust Capability Execution Roadmap](https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/Library/ZTCapabilitiesActivities.pdf). The sections correspond with the seven pillars of the DoD Zero Trust model.

## 2.2 Device detection and compliance

Microsoft Intune compliance policies ensure devices comply with organizational standards. Compliance policies can assess device configuration against a security baseline. Policies use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint protection state, and machine risk score, to determine compliance. Conditional Access uses device compliance state to make dynamic access decisions for users and devices, including bring-your-own-devices (BYOD).

## 2.3 Device authorization with real time inspection

Conditional Access is the Zero Trust policy engine for Microsoft cloud products and services. Evaluating Zero Trust policies at the IdP advances the comply-to-connect (C2C) model by applying adaptive controls before resource access. Conditional Access policies use security signals from Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft Defender XDR, and Microsoft Intune.

Microsoft Defender XDR components assess device and identity risk levels by using machine learning (ML) detections, and by enabling dynamic, risk-based decisions to allow, block, or control access to data, applications, assets, and services (DAAS).

## 2.6 Unified endpoint management and mobile device management

Microsoft Intune configuration and compliance policies ensure devices meet organizational security configuration requirements. Intune evaluates compliance policies and marks devices as compliant or noncompliant. Conditional Access policies can use device compliance state to block users with noncompliant devices from accessing resources protected by Microsoft Entra ID.

Microsoft Entra External ID cross-tenant access settings include trust settings for guest collaboration. These settings can be customized for each partner tenant. When you trust compliant devices from another tenant, guests using compliant devices in their home tenant satisfy Condtional Access policies requiring compliant devices in your tenant. You don’t need to make exceptions to Conditional Access policies to avoid blocking external guests.

|DoD Activity Description and Outcome|Microsoft guidance and recommendations|
|---|---|
|`Target` **2.6.1 Implement UEDM or equivalent tools**</br>DoD Organizations will work closely with the "Implement Asset, Vulnerability, and Patch Management tools" activity to procure and implement and Unified Endpoint and Device Management (UEDM) solution ensuring that requirements are integrated with the procurement process.

## 2.7 Endpoint and extended detection and response (EDR and XDR)

The Microsoft Defender XDR unified defense suite coordinates detection, prevention, investigation, and response across endpoints, identities, email, and applications. Microsoft Defender XDR components detect and defend against sophisticated attacks.

Integration of Microsoft Defender XDR components extends protection beyond devices. See example detection events that contribute to user risk level in Microsoft Entra ID Protection:

* Suspicious email-sending patterns detected by Microsoft Defender for Office
* Impossible travel detections in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps
* Attempts to access the primary refresh token detected by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

Risk-based Conditional Access policies can secure, limit, or block access to cloud services for the risky user, even if they use a compliant device on a trusted network.
