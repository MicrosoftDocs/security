# DoD Zero Trust Strategy for the network pillar

The [DoD Zero Trust Strategy and Roadmap](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3225919/department-of-defense-releases-zero-trust-strategy-and-roadmap/) outlines a path for Department of Defense components and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) partners to adopt a new cybersecurity framework based on Zero Trust principles. Zero Trust eliminates traditional perimeters and trust assumptions, enabling a more efficient architecture that enhances security, user experiences, and mission performance. 

This guide has recommendations for the 152 Zero Trust activities in the [DoD Zero Trust Capability Execution Roadmap](https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/Library/ZTCapabilitiesActivities.pdf). The sections correspond with the seven pillars of the DoD Zero Trust model.

## 5 Network

This section has Microsoft guidance and recommendations for DoD Zero Trust activities in the network pillar. To learn more, see [Secure networks with Zero Trust](/security/zero-trust/deploy/networks) for more information.

## 5.1 Data flow mapping

The Azure Virtual Network service is a building block in your private network in Azure. In virtual networks Azure resources communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises resources.

When you deploy a multiple hub-and-spoke network topology in Azure, Azure Firewall handles routing traffic between virtual networks. Also, Azure Firewall Premium includes security features like Trasport-Layer Security (TLS) inspection, network intrusion, detection, and prevention system (IDPS), URL filtering, and content filtering.

Azure network tools like Azure Network Watcher and Azure Monitor Network Insights help you map and visualize network traffic flow. Microsoft Sentinel integration enables visibility and control over organizational network traffic, with workbooks, automation, and detection capabilities.

## 5.3 Macro segmentation

Azure subscriptions are high-level constructs that separate Azure resources. Communication between resources in different subscriptions is explicitly provisioned. Virtual network (VNet) resources in a subscription provide network-level resource containment. By default, VNets canâ€™t communicate with other VNets. To enable network communication between VNets, peer them and use Azure Firewall to control and monitor the traffic.
