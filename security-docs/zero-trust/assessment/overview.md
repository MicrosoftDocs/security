# What is the Zero Trust Assessment?

We publish extensive guidance on how to configure [Microsoft Entra](/entra/fundamentals/configure-security) and [Microsoft Intune](/intune/intune-service/protect/zero-trust-configure-security) for increased security, but manually checking a tenant's configuration can be time consuming and error prone. The Zero Trust Assessment tool provides automation to check hundreds of these security configuration items aligned with the Secure Future Initiative (SFI) and Zero Trust pillars. 

It guides customers through remediation steps and helps operationalize Zero Trust principles. These checks come out of learnings influenced by accepted industry standards like those developed by NIST, the configuration baselines we use internally at Microsoft, and our experiences with customers.

Use the Zero Trust Assessment PowerShell module to run an automated security assessment. It checks your tenant configuration and recommends ways to improve security. The automated assessment helps you act quickly, reevaluate existing tenant security settings, and make changes ahead of product updates.
