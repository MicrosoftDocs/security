# Incident response with XDR and integrated SIEM

This solution guide shows you how to set up Microsoft extended detection and response (XDR) tools and how to integrate these with Microsoft Sentinel so your organization can respond to and remediate cybersecurity attacks faster.

Microsoft Defender XDR is an XDR solution that automatically collects, correlates, and analyzes signal, threat, and alert data from across your Microsoft 365 environment.

Microsoft Sentinel is a cloud-native solution that provides security information and event management (SIEM) and security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) capabilities. Together, Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender XDR provide a comprehensive solution to help organizations defend against modern attacks.

This guidance helps you improve your Zero Trust architecture by mapping the principles of Zero Trust in the following ways:

| Zero Trust Principleâ€¯| Met by|
|--|:--|
Verify explicitly | Microsoft Sentinel collects data from across the environment and analyzes threats and anomalies so your organization and any automation can act on verified data. <br><br>Microsoft Defender XDR provides extended detection and response across users, identities, devices, apps, and emails. Configure Microsoft Sentinel automation to use risk-based signals captured by Microsoft Defender XDR to take action, such as blocking or authorizing traffic based on risk.
Use least privileged access | Microsoft Sentinel detects anomalous activity through its UEBA engine. As security scenarios change rapidly, its threat intelligence imports data from Microsoft and third-party providers to detect and contextualize emerging threats. <br><br>Microsoft Defender XDR includes Microsoft Entra ID Protection to block users based on identity risk. Feed related data into Microsoft Sentinel for further analysis and automation.
Assume breach | Microsoft Defender XDR continuously scans the environment for threats and vulnerabilities. Microsoft Sentinel analyzes collected data and behavioral trends to detect suspicious activity, anomalies, and multistage threats across the enterprise.<br><br>Both Microsoft Defender XDR and Microsoft Sentinel implement automated remediation tasks, including investigations, device isolation, and data quarantine. Use device risk as a signal for Microsoft Entra Conditional Access.

## Getting started with Microsoft Defender XDR

Deploying Microsoft Defender XDR is a great starting point for building incident detection and response abilities within your organization. Defender XDR is included with Microsoft 365 E5 and you can even get started by using [Microsoft 365 E5 trial licenses](/defender-xdr/pilot-deploy-overview#using-microsoft-365-e5-trial-licenses). Defender XDR can be integrated with Microsoft Sentinel or with a [generic SIEM tool](/defender-cloud-apps/siem).

For more information, see [Pilot and deploy Microsoft Defender XDR](/defender-xdr/pilot-deploy-overview?toc=%2Fsecurity%2Fzero-trust%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fsecurity%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json).

## Microsoft Sentinel and XDR architecture

Microsoft Sentinel customers can use one of these methods to integrate Microsoft Sentinel with Microsoft Defender XDR services:

- Onboard Microsoft Sentinel to the Defender portal to use it together with Microsoft Defender XDR for unified security operations. View Microsoft Sentinel data directly in the Defender portal alongside your Defender incidents, alerts, vulnerabilities, and security data.

- Use Microsoft Sentinel data connectors to ingest Microsoft Defender XDR service data into Microsoft Sentinel. View Microsoft Sentinel data in the Azure portal.

This guidance center provides information for both methods. If you've onboarded your workspace to the Defender portal, use it; if not, use the Azure portal unless otherwise indicated.

## [Defender portal](#tab/defender-portal)

The following illustration shows how Microsoft's XDR solution integrates with Microsoft Sentinel in the Defender portal.

## What's in this solution

This solution helps your security operations team remediate incidents using a Zero Trust approach by guiding you through Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender XDR implementation. The implementation includes these phases:


|Phase  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|1. [Pilot and deploy Microsoft Defender XDR services](/defender-xdr/pilot-deploy-overview?bc=/security/breadcrumb/toc.json&toc=/security/zero-trust/toc.json)     |  Start by piloting Microsoft Defender XDR services so you can evaluate their features and capabilities before you complete the deployment across your organization.       |
|2. [Plan your deployment](/unified-secops-platform/overview-plan?bc=/security/breadcrumb/toc.json&toc=/security/zero-trust/toc.json)     |  Then, plan your full SIEM and XDR deployment, including the XDR services and the workspace for Microsoft Sentinel.       |
|3. [Set up XDR tools and architect your workspace](/unified-secops-platform/overview-deploy?bc=/security/breadcrumb/toc.json&toc=/security/zero-trust/toc.json)     |   In this phase, deploy the XDR services you decided to use across your environment, deploy Microsoft Sentinel and other services to support your SIEM and XDR solution.  <br><br>    If you plan to work from the Azure portal, skip the step to [connect Microsoft Sentinel to the Microsoft Defender portal](/defender-xdr/microsoft-sentinel-onboard?bc=/security/breadcrumb/toc.json&toc=/security/zero-trust/toc.json). This step is only relevant if you want to use Microsoft Sentinel Defender portal, and is not relevant if you want to respond to incidents in the Azure portal.    |
|4. Respond to incidents     |  Finally, respond to incidents based on whether you onboarded to the Defender portal:    <br>    - [Respond to an incident from the Defender portal](respond-incident-defender.md) <br> - [Respond to an incident from the Azure portal](respond-incident-azure.md)   |
