# Secure all of your AI agents with Microsoft Agent 365

Secure AI agents in Microsoft Copilot 365 and Microsoft 365 admin center using Microsoft Agent 365.

Agent 365 provides comprehensive observability and security capabilities for AI agents within your organization built on Microsoft security core primitives provided by Microsoft Purview, Microsoft Defender, and Microsoft Entra.

Secure agents created using Foundry, Copilot Studio, Copilot 365, and third-parties

For the SOC

Security tools: Purview, Defender, Entra

- Observability: Monitor AI agent activities, data access, and interactions across your organization.
- Access Control: Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) and conditional access policies to manage who can create, deploy, and interact with AI agents.
- Data Protection: Use data loss prevention (DLP) policies and encryption to safeguard sensitive information accessed or processed by AI agents.
- Threat Detection: Leverage Microsoft Defender to identify and respond to potential threats or anomalies in AI agent behavior.
