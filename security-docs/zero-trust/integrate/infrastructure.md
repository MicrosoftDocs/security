# Infrastructure integrations

:::image type="icon" source="../media/icon-infrastructure-medium.png":::

Infrastructure comprises the hardware, software, micro-services, networking infrastructure, and facilities required to support IT services for an organization. Zero Trust infrastructure solutions assess, monitor, and prevent security threats to these services.

Zero Trust infrastructure solutions support the principles of Zero Trust by ensuring that access to infrastructure resources is verified explicitly, access is granted using principles of least privilege access, and mechanisms are in place that assume breach and look for and remediate security threats in infrastructure.

This guidance is for software providers and technology partners who want to enhance their infrastructure security solutions by integrating with Microsoft products.

## Zero Trust integration for Infrastructure guide

This integration guide includes strategy and instructions for integrating with [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/security-center/security-center-introduction) and its integrated cloud workload protection plans, **Microsoft Defender for ...** (Servers, Containers, Databases, Storage, App Services, and more).

The guidance includes integrations with the most popular Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), Security Orchestration Automated Response (SOAR), Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), and IT Service Management (ITSM) solutions.

### Zero Trust and Defender for Cloud

Our [Zero Trust infrastructure deployment guidance](../deploy/infrastructure.md) provides key stages of the Zero Trust strategy for infrastructure. These are:

1. Assess compliance with chosen standards and policies
1. Harden configuration wherever gaps are found
1. Employ other hardening tools such as just-in-time (JIT) VM access
1. Set up threat detection and protections
1. Automatically block and flag risky behavior and take protective actions

There's a clear mapping from the goals we've described in the [infrastructure deployment guidance](../deploy/infrastructure.md) to the core aspects of Defender for Cloud.

|Zero Trust goal  | Defender for Cloud feature  |
|---------|---------|
|Assess compliance | In Defender for Cloud, every subscription automatically has the [Microsoft cloud security benchmark (MCSB)](/security/benchmark/azure/introduction) assigned as the [default security initiative](/azure/defender-for-cloud/security-policy-concept).<br>Using the [secure score tools](/azure/defender-for-cloud/secure-score-security-controls) and the [regulatory compliance dashboard](/azure/defender-for-cloud/update-regulatory-compliance-packages) you can get a deep understanding of your customer's security posture. |
|Harden configuration | Assigning security initiatives to subscriptions, and reviewing the secure score, leads you to the [hardening recommendations](/azure/security-center/recommendations-reference) built into Defender for Cloud. Defender for Cloud periodically analyzes the compliance status of resources to identify potential security misconfigurations and weaknesses. It then provides recommendations on how to remediate those issues.    |
|Employ hardening mechanisms | As well as one-time fixes to security misconfigurations, Defender for Cloud includes features to further harden your resources such as:<br>[Just-in-time (JIT) virtual machine (VM) access](/azure/defender-for-cloud/just-in-time-access-usage)<br>[Adaptive network hardening](/azure/defender-for-cloud/adaptive-network-hardening)<br>[Adaptive application controls](/azure/defender-for-cloud/adaptive-application-controls). |
|Set up threat detection  | Defender for Cloud offers integrated cloud workload protection plans, for threat detection and response. The plans provide advanced, intelligent, protection of Azure, hybrid, and multicloud resources and workloads.<br>One of the Microsoft Defender plans, Defender for servers, includes a native integration with [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/).<br>Learn more in [Introduction to Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction). |
|Automatically block suspicious behavior | Many of the hardening recommendations in Defender for Cloud offer a *deny* option. This feature lets you prevent the creation of resources that don't satisfy defined hardening criteria. Learn more in [Prevent misconfigurations with Enforce/Deny recommendations](/azure/defender-for-cloud/prevent-misconfigurations).  |
|Automatically flag suspicious behavior | Microsoft Defender for Cloud's security alerts are triggered by advanced detections. Defender for Cloud prioritizes and lists the alerts, along with the information needed for you to quickly investigate the problem. Defender for Cloud also provides detailed steps to help you remediate attacks. For a full list of the available alerts, see [Security alerts - a reference guide](/azure/defender-for-cloud/alerts-reference).|

### Integrate Defender for Cloud with an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution

#### Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

[Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/) is a holistic, cloud-delivered endpoint security solution.

[Microsoft Defender for servers](/azure/security-center/defender-for-servers-introduction), includes an integrated license for [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/endpoint-defender). Together, they provide comprehensive endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities. For more information, see [Protect your endpoints](/azure/defender-for-cloud/integration-defender-for-endpoint?tabs=linux).

When Defender for Endpoint detects a threat, it triggers an alert. The alert is shown in Defender for Cloud and you can pivot to the Defender for Endpoint console to perform a detailed investigation and uncover the scope of the attack. [Learn more about Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint).

#### Other EDR solutions

Defender for Cloud provides hardening recommendations to ensure you're securing your organization's resources according to the guidance of [Microsoft cloud security benchmark (MCSB)](/security/benchmark/azure/introduction). One of the controls in the benchmark relates to endpoint security: [ES-1: Use Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)](/security/benchmark/azure/security-controls-v2-endpoint-security).

There are two recommendations in Defender for Cloud to ensure you've enabled endpoint protection and it's running well. These recommendations are checking for the presence and operational health of EDR solutions from:

- Trend Micro
- Symantec
- McAfee
- Sophos

Learn more in [Endpoint protection assessment and recommendations in Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/security-center/security-center-endpoint-protection).

### Apply your Zero Trust strategy to hybrid and multi cloud scenarios

With cloud workloads commonly spanning multiple cloud platforms, cloud security services must do the same.

Microsoft Defender for Cloud protects workloads wherever they're running: in Azure, on-premises, Amazon Web Services (AWS), or Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

#### Integrate Defender for Cloud with on-premises machines

To secure hybrid cloud workloads, you can extend Defender for Cloud's protections by connecting on-premises machines to [Azure Arc enabled servers](/azure/azure-arc/servers/overview).

Learn about how to connect machines in [Connect your non-Azure machines to Defender for Cloud](/azure/security-center/quickstart-onboard-machines?pivots=azure-arc).

#### Integrate Defender for Cloud with other cloud environments

To view the security posture of **Amazon Web Services** machines in Defender for Cloud, onboard  AWS accounts into Defender for Cloud. This will integrate AWS Security Hub and Microsoft Defender for Cloud for a unified view of Defender for Cloud recommendations and AWS Security Hub findings and provide a range of benefits as described in [Connect your AWS accounts to Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/defender-for-cloud/quickstart-onboard-aws).

To view the security posture of **Google Cloud Platform** machines in Defender for Cloud, onboard GCP accounts into Defender for Cloud. This will integrate GCP Security Command and Microsoft Defender for Cloud for a unified view of Defender for Cloud recommendations and GCP Security Command Center findings and provide a range of benefits as described in [Connect your GCP accounts to Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/defender-for-cloud/quickstart-onboard-gcp).
