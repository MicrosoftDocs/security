# Audit Requirements - Microsoft Trusted Root Certificate Program


This page sets out the requirements for Certification Authorities (CAs)
who participate in the Microsoft Trusted Root Certificate Program
(\"Program\") along with the requirements to use each of the EKUs that
Microsoft currently supports as part of the Microsoft Trusted Root
Certificate Program.

Below you will find the requirements for both Commercial CAs and
Government CAs along with information about what constitutes a
Government CA. (See \"Definitions\", below). Additionally, you will find
information about how the requirements are changing for Government CAs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


## General Requirements


Microsoft requires that every CA submit evidence of a Qualifying Audit on an annual basis for the CA and any non-limited root within its PKI chain. A Qualifying Audit must meet the following five main requirements:

1.  the auditor must be qualified,
2.  the audit must be performed using the proper scope,
3.  the audit must be performed using the proper standard, and
4.  the audit must be performed and the attestation letter must be
    issued within the proper time period, and
5.  the auditor must complete and submit a Qualifying Attestation.

It is the responsibility of the CA to provide Microsoft with a Qualifying Attestation to the results of the audit as well as conformance to the Audit Requirements in a timely manner.

 

### A. The Auditor's Qualifications


Microsoft considers an auditor to be a Qualified Auditor if s/he is an independent individual or company that is certified to perform certification authority audits by one of these three authorities: (1) WebTrust, (2) an ETSI Equivalent National Authority (published at <https://aka.ms/ena>) or, (3) in the case of a Government CA, the government itself. (For more information on Government CAs, see \"Government CA Requirements\" below.)

If a CA chooses to obtain a WebTrust audit, Microsoft requires the CA to
retain a WebTrust licensed auditor to perform the audit. The full list
of WebTrust-licensed auditors is available at
<https://aka.ms/webtrustauditors>. If a CA chooses to obtain an
ETSI-based audit, Microsoft requires the CA to retain an authorized
entity by an Equivalent National Authority (or \"ENAs\"). A catalogue of
acceptable ENAs is based on the list at <https://aka.ms/ena>. If a CA is
operated in a country that does not have an ETSI Equivalent National
Authority, Microsoft will accept an audit performed by an auditor that
is qualified under an Equivalent National Authority in the auditor\'s
home country.


### B. The Scope of the Audit

The scope of the audit must include all roots, non-limited sub-roots,
and cross-signed non-enrolled roots, under the root, except for
sub-roots that are limited to a verified domain. The audit must also
document the full PKI hierarchy. The final audit statements must be in a
publicly-accessible location and must contain the start and end dates of
the audit period. In the case of a WebTrust audit, WebTrust seal(s) must
also be in a publicly-accessible location.



### C. Point-in-Time Readiness Assessments


Microsoft requires an audit prior to commencing commercial operations.
For commercial CAs that have not been operational as an issuer of
certificates for 90 days or more, Microsoft will accept a point-in-time
readiness audit conducted by a Qualified Auditor. If the CA uses a
point-in-time readiness audit, Microsoft requires a follow-up audit
within 90 days after the CA issues its first certificate. A commercial
CA already in our program applying for a new root to be included is
exempt from the point-in-time and period-in-time audit requirement for
the new roots.  Rather, they should be up to date on audits for their
existing roots in the program.


### D. The Time Period Between the Assessment and the Auditor's Attestation


Microsoft requires that the CA obtain a conforming audit annually. To
ensure that Microsoft has information that accurately reflects the
current business practices of the CA, the attestation letter arising
from the audit must be dated and received by Microsoft not more than 3
months from the ending date specified in the attestation letter.


### E. Audit Attestation


Microsoft requires that each auditor complete and submit to Microsoft a
Qualifying Attestation. A Qualifying Attestation requires that the
auditor completes a Qualifying Attestation Letter.



Microsoft uses a tool to automatically parse audit letters to validate
the accuracy of the Qualifying Attestation Letter. This tool is found in
the Common Certification Authority Database (CCADB). Please work with
your auditor to make sure the Qualifying Attestation Letter fulfills the
following requirements. If the audit letter fails in any of these
categories, a mail will be sent back to the CA asking them to update
their audit letter.
#### ALL CAS 
1.  Audit letter must be written in English
2.  Audit letter must be in a "Text Searchable" PDF format.
3.  Audit letter must have the auditor's name in the audit letter as
    recorded in CCADB.   
4.  Audit letter must list either SHA1 thumbprint or SHA256 thumbprint
    of audited roots.
5.  Audit letter must list the date the audit letter was written.
6.  Audit letter must state the start and end dates of the period that
    was audited.  Please note that this is not the period the auditor
    was on-site.
7.  The audit letter must include the full name of the CA as recorded in
    CCADB.
8. Audit letter must list the audit standards that were used during the
    audit. Please reference WebTrust/ETSI guidelines or
    <https://aka.ms/auditreqs> and list the full name and version of the
    audit standards referenced.

    
#### CAs submitting Webtrust audits
1.  Audits conducted by certified WebTrust auditors must have their
    audit letters uploaded to
    [https://cert.webtrust.org](https://cert.webtrust.org/). 

    
#### CAs submitting ETSI audits
1.  Audits conducted by certified ETSI auditors should have their audit
    letters uploaded to their auditor's website. If the auditor does not post on their website, the CA must provide the name and email of the auditor when submitting the audit letter. A Microsoft representative will reach out to the auditor to verify the authenticity of the letter. 
2. CAs may submit audits with either the EN 319 411-2 or 411-2 policy. 

### F. Audit Submission


To submit annual audits, please refer to the CCADB instructions on how
to create an audit case found here: <https://ccadb.org/cas/updates>.

If the CA is applying into the Root Store and is not in the CCADB, they
should email their audit attestation to msroot\@microsoft.com.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conventional CA Audit Standards


The Program accepts two types of audit standards: WebTrust and ETSI. For
each of the EKUs on the left, Microsoft requires an audit that conforms
to the standard marked.

### A. WebTrust Audits


Microsoft will now be requiring the WebTrust Trust Services Principles
and Criteria for Certification Authorities -- Code Signing for any audit
statements with periods commencing on or after January 1, 2018. This
will be required for any CA that has the code signing EKU enabled for
their roots. If a CA has the code signing EKU enabled on a root but is
not actively issuing code signing certificates, they may reach out the
msroot\@microsoft.com to have the EKU status set to "NotBefore." 



| Criteria | WebTrust for CA v2.1 | SSL Baseline with Network Security v2.3 | Extended Validation SSL v1.6.2 | Extended Validation Code Signing v1.4.1 | Publicly Trusted Code Signing Certificates v1.0.1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Server Authentication (Non-EV) | X | X |  |  |  |
| Server Authentication (non-EV) and Client Authentication only | X | X |  |  |  |
| Server Authentication (EV) | X | X | X |  |  |
| Server Authentication (EV) and Client Authentication only | X | X | X |  |  |
| EV Code Signing | X |  |  | X |  |
| Non-EV Code Signing and Time stamping | X |  |  |  | X |
| Secured Email (S/MIME) | X |  |  |  |  |
| Client Authentication (without Server Authentication) | X |  |  |  |  |
| Document Signing | X |  |  |  |  |



### B. ETSI-Based Audits


Note 1: If a CA uses an ETSI-based audit, it must perform a **full**
audit annually, and Microsoft will not accept surveillance audits. 
Note 2: All ETSI audits statements must be audited against the CA/Browser Forum requirements and compliance to these requirements must be stated in the audit letter. The ACAB'c [https://acab-c.com] has provided guidance that meets the Microsoft requirements.  

| Criteria | EN 319 411-1: DVCP, OVCP or PTC-BR policies | EN 319 411-1: EVCP policy | EN 319 411-2: QCP-w policy (based on EN 319 411-1, EVCP) | EN 319 411-1: LCP, NCP, NCP+ policies | EN 319 411-2: QCP-n, QCP-n-qscd, QCP-l, QCP-l-qscd policies (based on EN 319 411-1, NCP/NCP+)  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Server Authentication (Non-EV) | X |  |  |  |  |
| Server Authentication (non-EV) and Client Authentication only | X |  |  |  |  |
| Server Authentication (EV) |  | X |  |  |  |
| Server Authentication (EV) and Client Authentication only |  | X | X |  |  |
| EV Code Signing |  |  | X | X |  |
| Non-EV Code Signing and Time stamping |  |  |  | X | X |

| Document Signing |  |  |  | X | X |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Government CA Requirements


Government CAs may choose to either obtain the above WebTrust or ETSI-based audit(s) required of Commercial CAs, or to use an Equivalent Audit. If a Government CA chooses to obtain a WebTrust or ETSI-based audit, Microsoft will treat the Government CA as a Commercial CA. The Government CA can then operate without limiting the certificates it issues.

### A. Equivalent Audit Restrictions

If the Government CA chooses not to use a WebTrust or ETSI audit, it may obtain an Equivalent Audit. In an Equivalent Audit (\"EA\"), the Government CA selects a third party to perform an audit. The audit has two purposes: (1) to demonstrate that the Government CA complies with local laws and regulations related to certificate authority operation, and (2) to demonstrate that the audit substantially complies with the relevant WebTrust or ETSI standard.

If a Government CA chooses to obtain an EA, Microsoft will limit the scope of certificates that the Government CA may issue. Government CAs that issue server authentication certificates must limit the root to government-controlled domains. Governments must limit the issuance of any other certificates to ISO3166 country codes that the country has sovereign control over.

Government CAs must also accept and adopt the appropriate, CAB forum baseline requirements for CAs based on the type of certificates the root issues. However, the Program Requirements and Audit Requirements supersede those requirements in any aspect in which they are in conflict.

All Government CAs entering the Program will be subject to the above EA requirements. All Government CAs that are part of the Program prior to June 1, 2015 will be subject to the above EA requirements immediately upon expiration of their then-current audit.



### B. Content of the Equivalent Audit Report


Microsoft requires all Government CAs that submit an EA to provide an
attestation letter from the auditor that:

1.  Attests that the audit is issued by an independent agency which is
    authorized by the Government CA\'s government to conduct the audit;
2.  Lists the Government CA\'s government\'s criteria for auditor
    qualification, and certifies that the auditor meets this criteria;
3.  Lists the particular statutes, rules, and/or regulations that the
    auditor assessed the Government CA\'s operations against;
4.  Certifies the Government CA\'s compliance with the requirements
    outlined in the named governing statutes, rules, and/or regulations;
5.  Provides information that describes how the statute\'s requirements
    are equivalent to the appropriate WebTrust or ETSI audit(s) ;
6.  Lists Certificate Authorities and third parties authorized by the
    Government CA to issue certificates on the Government CA\'s behalf
    within a certificate chain;
7.  Documents the full PKI hierarchy; and
8.  Provides the start and end date of the audit period.
