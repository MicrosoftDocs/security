# What do we mean by Zero Trust compliance?

This article provides overview of application security from a developer's perspective to address the guiding principles of [Zero Trust](overview.md). In the past, code security was all about your own app: if you got it wrong, your own app was at risk. Today, cybersecurity is a high priority for customers and governments worldwide.

Compliance with cybersecurity requirements is a prerequisite for many customers and governments to purchase applications. For example, see [U.S. Executive Order 14028: Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/) and [U.S. General Services Administration requirements summary](https://www.gsa.gov/technology/it-contract-vehicles-and-purchasing-programs/information-technology-category/it-security/executive-order-14028). Your application needs to meet customer requirements.

Cloud security is a consideration of organization infrastructure that is only as secure as the weakest link. When a single app is the weakest link, malicious actors can gain access to business-critical data and operations.

Application security from a developer perspective includes a Zero Trust approach: applications address the guiding principles of Zero Trust. As a developer, you continuously update your application as the threat landscape and security guidance changes.

## Supporting Zero Trust principles in your code

Two keys to compliance with Zero Trust principles are the ability of your application to verify explicitly and to support least privilege access. Your application should [delegate identity and access management](identity-iam-development-best-practices.md) to Microsoft Entra ID so that it can use Microsoft Entra tokens. Delegating identity and access management enables your application to support customer technologies such as multi-factor authentication, passwordless authentication, and conditional access policies.

With the [Microsoft identity platform](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-overview) and Zero Trust enabling technologies (as shown in the following diagram), using Microsoft Entra tokens helps your application to integrate with Microsoft's entire suite of security technologies.

If your application requires passwords, you may be exposing your customers to avoidable risk. Bad actors view the shift to working from any location with any device as an opportunity to access corporate data by perpetrating activities such as password spray attacks. In a password spray attack, bad actors try a promising password across a set of user accounts. For example, they might try GoSeaHawks2022! against user accounts in the Seattle area. This successful attack type is one justification for passwordless authentication.

## Acquiring access tokens from Microsoft Entra ID

At a minimum, your application needs to [acquire access tokens](acquire-application-authorization-to-access-resources.md) from Microsoft Entra ID that issues OAuth 2.0 access tokens. Your client application can use these tokens to obtain limited access to user resources via API calls on the user's behalf. You use an access token to call each API.

When a delegated identity provider verifies identity, your customer's IT department can enforce least privilege access with Microsoft Entra permission and consent. Microsoft Entra ID determines when it issues tokens to applications.

When your customers understand which corporate resources your application needs to access, they can correctly grant or deny access requests. For example, if your application needs to access Microsoft SharePoint, document this requirement so that you can help customers grant the correct permissions.
