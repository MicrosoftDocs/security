# July 2019 Deployment Notice (10/July) - Microsoft Trusted Root Program 

On Wednesday, July 10th, 2019,  Microsoftâ€™s Trusted Root Certificate Program released an unscheduled update to the Trusted Root Store to 
restore EKUs on the OpenTrust Root CA G1 root (7991E834F7E2EEDD08950152E9552D14E958D57E).

This update does not contain any other changes.



>[!NOTE]
> Please note: As part of this release, Microsoft also updated the Untrusted CTL time stamp and sequence number. 
No changes were made to the contents of the Untrusted CTL but this will cause your system to download/refresh the Untrusted CTL. 
This is a normal update that is sometimes done when the Trusted Root CTL is updated.
