# Overview – Apply Zero Trust principles to Azure IaaS

**Summary:** To apply Zero Trust principles to Azure IaaS components and infrastructure, you must first understand the common reference architecture and the components of Azure storage, virtual machines, and spoke and hub virtual networks.

This series of articles help you apply the principles of Zero Trust to your workloads in Microsoft Azure IaaS based on a multi-disciplinary approach to applying the Zero Trust principles. Zero Trust is a security strategy. It isn't a product or a service, but an approach in designing and implementing the following set of security principles:

- Verify explicitly
- Use least privileged access
- Assume breach

Implementing the Zero Trust mindset to "assume breach, never trust, always verify" requires changes to cloud infrastructure, deployment strategy, and implementation.

These initial series of five articles (including this introduction) show you how to apply Zero Trust approach to a common IT business scenario based on infrastructure services. The work is broken into units that can be configured together as follows:

- [Azure storage](azure-infrastructure-storage.md)
- [Virtual machines](azure-infrastructure-virtual-machines.md)
- [Spoke virtual networks (VNets) for virtual machine-based workloads](azure-infrastructure-iaas.md)
- [Hub VNets to support access to many workloads in Azure](azure-infrastructure-networking.md)

For more information, see [Apply Zero Trust principles to Azure Virtual Desktop](azure-infrastructure-avd.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Additional articles will be added to this series in the future, including how organizations can apply a Zero Trust approach to applications, networking, data, and DevOps services based on real IT business environments.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This Zero Trust guidance describes how to use and configure several security solutions and features available on Azure for a reference architecture. Several other resources also provide security guidance for these solutions and features, including:

> - [Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark](/security/benchmark/azure/introduction)
> - [Microsoft Cloud Security Baseline](/security/benchmark/azure/security-baselines-overview)

To describe how to apply a Zero Trust approach, this guidance targets a common pattern used in production by many organizations: a virtual-machine-based application hosted in a VNet (and IaaS application). This is a common pattern for organizations migrating on-premises applications to Azure, which is sometimes referred to as "lift-and-shift." The reference architecture includes all components necessary to support this application, including storage services and a hub VNet.

The reference architecture reflects a common deployment pattern in production environments. It isn't based on the enterprise-scale landing zones recommended in the Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF), although many of the best practices in CAF are included in the reference architecture, such as using a dedicated VNet to host components that broker access to the application (hub VNet).

If you're interested in learning about the guidance recommended in the Cloud Adoption Framework Azure landing zones, see these resources:

- [Get started with the Cloud Adoption Framework](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/get-started/index)
- [What is an Azure landing zone?](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/index)

## Reference architecture

The following figure shows the reference architecture for this Zero Trust guidance.

:::image type="content" source="media/azure-infra-overview/azure-infra-overview-reference-architecture-1.svg" alt-text="The reference architecture for applying Zero Trust to Azure IaaS that contains different types of users, common applications running on virtual machines, PaaS services, and storage." lightbox="media/azure-infra-overview/azure-infra-overview-reference-architecture-1.svg":::

This architecture contains:

- Multiple IaaS components and elements, including different types of users and IT consumers accessing the app from different sites. such as Azure, the internet, on-premises, and branch offices.
- A common three-tier application containing a front end tier, application tier, and data tier. All tiers run on virtual machines within a VNet named SPOKE. Access to the app is protected by another VNet named HUB that contains additional security services.
- Some of the most used PaaS services on Azure that support IaaS applications, including role-based access control (RBAC) and Microsoft Entra ID, which contribute to the Zero Trust security approach.
- Storage Blobs and Storage Files that provide object storage for the applications and files shared by users.

This series of articles walk through the recommendations for implementing Zero Trust for the reference architecture by addressing each of these larger pieces hosted in Azure, as shown here.

:::image type="content" source="media/azure-infra-overview/azure-infra-overview.svg" alt-text="The reference architecture for applying Zero Trust to Azure IaaS that shows the grouped components for storage, virtual machines, and spoke and hub virtual networks." lightbox="media/azure-infra-overview/azure-infra-overview.svg":::

The diagram outlines the larger areas of the architecture that are addressed by each article in this series:

1. [Azure Storage Services](azure-infrastructure-storage.md)
2. [Virtual machines](azure-infrastructure-virtual-machines.md)
3. [Spoke VNets](azure-infrastructure-iaas.md)
4. [Hub VNets](azure-infrastructure-networking.md)

It’s important to note that the guidance in this series of articles is more specific for this type of architecture than the guidance provided in the Cloud Adoption Framework and Azure landing zone architectures. If you applied the guidance in either of these resources, be sure to also review this series of articles for additional recommendations.  

## Understanding Azure components

The reference architecture diagram provides a topological view of the environment. It’s also valuable to see logically how each of the components can be organized within the Azure environment. The following diagram provides a way to organize your subscriptions and resource groups. Your Azure subscriptions might be organized differently.

:::image type="content" source="media/azure-infra-overview/azure-infra-overview-subscription-architecture-3.svg" alt-text="The logical architecture for applying Zero Trust to Azure IaaS showing subscriptions, Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Azure Monitor, and resource groups within an Entra ID tenant." lightbox="media/azure-infra-overview/azure-infra-overview-subscription-architecture-3.svg":::

In this diagram, the Azure infrastructure is contained within an Entra ID tenant. The following table describes the different sections shown in the diagram.

- Azure subscriptions

   You can distribute the resources in more than one subscription, where each subscription may hold different roles, such as network subscription, or security subscription. This is described in the Cloud Adoption Framework and Azure Landing Zone documentation previously referenced. The different subscriptions may also hold different environments, such as production, development, and tests environments. It depends on how you want to separate your environment and the number of resources you'll have in each. One or more subscriptions can be managed together using a Management Group. This gives you the ability to apply permissions with role based access control (RBAC) and Azure policies to a group of subscriptions instead of setting up each subscription individually.

- Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Azure Monitor

   For each Azure subscription, a set of Azure Monitor solutions and Defender for Cloud is available. If you manage these subscriptions through a Management Group, you're able to consolidate in a single portal for all the functionality of Azure Monitor and Defender for Cloud. For example, Secure Score, provided by Defender for Cloud, are consolidated for all your subscriptions, using a Management Group as the scope.

- Storage resource group (1)

   The storage account is contained in a dedicated resource group. You can isolate each storage account in a different resource group for more granular permission control. Azure storage services are contained within a dedicated storage account. You can have one storage account for each type of storage workload, for example an Object Storage (also called Blob storage) and Azure Files. This provides more granular access control and can improve performance.

- Virtual machines resource group (2)

   Virtual machines are contained in one resource group. You can also have each virtual machine type for workload tiers such as front end, application, and data in different resource groups to further isolate access control.

- Spoke (3) and hub (4) VNet resource groups in separate subscriptions

   The network and other resources for each of the VNets in the reference architecture are isolated within dedicated resource groups for spoke and hub VNets. This organization works well when responsibility for these live on different teams. Another option is to organize these components by putting all network resources in one resource group and security resources in another. It depends on how your organization is set up to manage these resources.

## Threat Protection with Microsoft Defender for Cloud

**Microsoft Defender for Cloud** is an extended detection and response (XDR) solution that automatically collects, correlates, and analyzes signal, threat, and alert data from across your environment. Defender for Cloud is intended to be used together with Microsoft Defender XDR to provide a greater breadth of correlated protection of your environment, as shown in the following diagram.

:::image type="content" source="media/azure-infra-overview/azure-infra-overview-threat-protection.svg" alt-text="The logical architecture of Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Defender XDR that provides threat protection for Azure IaaS components." lightbox="media/azure-infra-overview/azure-infra-overview-threat-protection.svg":::

In the diagram:

- Defender for Cloud is enabled for a management group that includes multiple Azure subscriptions.
- Microsoft Defender XDR is enabled for Microsoft 365 apps and data, SaaS apps that are integrated with Microsoft Entra ID, and on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) servers.

For more information about configuring management groups and enabling Defender for Cloud, see:
