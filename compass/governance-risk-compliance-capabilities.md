This article lists capabilities that can help with governance, risk, and compliance. You can also learn more about these capabilities at [Azure governance documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/).

|---------|---------|---------|
| Microsoft 365 security center|Microsoft 365 security center provides security administrators and other risk management professionals with a centralized hub and specialized workspace that enables them to manage and take full advantage of Microsoft 365 intelligent security solutions for identity and access management, threat protection, information protection, and security management.  | [Microsoft 365 security center](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/mtp/overview-security-center?view=o365-worldwide)|
|Microsoft 365 compliance center|Microsoft 365 compliance center provides easy access to the data and tools you need to manage to your organization's compliance needs.|[Microsoft 365 compliance center](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/microsoft-365-compliance-center?view=o365-worldwide)|
|Azure Security Center     | Azure Security Center is a unified infrastructure security management system that strengthens the security posture of your data centers, and provides advanced threat protection across your hybrid workloads in the cloud - whether they're in Azure or not - as well as on premises. | [Azure Security Center documentation ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/)      |
|Management Groups     | If your organization has many subscriptions, you may need a way to efficiently manage access, policies, and compliance for those subscriptions. Azure management groups provide a level of scope above subscriptions. You organize subscriptions into containers called "management groups" and apply your governance conditions to the management groups.        |[Organize your resources with Azure management groups ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/management-groups/overview)        |
|Azure Policy     |Azure Policy is a service in Azure that you use to create, assign, and manage policies. These policies enforce different rules and effects over your resources, so those resources stay compliant with your corporate standards and service level agreements.         |  [Azure Policy documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/)       |
|Azure Blueprints    | Azure Blueprints enables cloud architects and central information technology groups to define a repeatable set of Azure resources that implements and adheres to an organization's standards, patterns, and requirements. Azure Blueprints makes it possible for development teams to rapidly build and stand up new environments with trust they're building within organizational compliance with a set of built-in components -- such as networking -- to speed up development and delivery.       |   [Azure Blueprints documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/blueprints/overview)      |
