# Develop using Zero Trust principles

This article will help you, as a developer, to understand the guiding principles of Zero Trust so that you can improve your application security. You play a key role in organizational security; applications and their developers can no longer assume that the network perimeter is secure. Compromised applications can affect the entire organization.

Organizations are deploying new security models that adapt to complex modern environments and embrace the mobile workforce. New models are designed protect people, devices, applications, and data wherever they're located. Organizations are striving to achieve [Zero Trust](../zero-trust-overview.md), a security strategy and approach for designing and implementing applications that follow these guiding principles:

* Verify explicitly
* Use least privilege access
* Assume breach

Instead of believing everything behind the corporate firewall is safe, the Zero Trust model assumes breach and verifies each request as though it originated from an uncontrolled network. Regardless of where the request originates or what resource it accesses, the Zero Trust model requires us to "never trust, always verify."

Understand that Zero Trust isn't a replacement for security fundamentals. With work originating from anywhere on any device, design your applications to incorporate Zero Trust principles throughout your development cycle.

## Why develop with a Zero Trust perspective?

* We've seen a rise in the level of sophistication of cybersecurity attacks.
* The "work from anywhere" workforce has redefined the security perimeter. Data is being accessed outside the corporate network and shared with external collaborators such as partners and vendors.
* Corporate applications and data are moving from on-premises to hybrid and cloud environments. Traditional network controls can no longer be relied on for security. Controls need to move to where the data is: on devices and inside apps.

The development guidance in this section will help you to increase security, reduce the blast radius of a security incident, and swiftly recover by using Microsoft technology.

## Next steps

### Developer guidance overview

* [What do we mean by Zero Trust compliance?](identity-zero-trust-compliance.md) provides an overview of application security from a developer's perspective to address the guiding principles of Zero Trust.
* Use [Zero Trust identity and access management development best practices](identity-iam-development-best-practices.md) in your application development lifecycle to create secure applications.
* [Using standards-based development methodologies](identity-standards-based-development-methodologies.md) provides an overview of supported standards (OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, SAML, WS-Federation, and SCIM) and the benefits of using them with MSAL and the Microsoft identity platform.
* [Developer and administrator responsibilities for application registration, authorization, and access](identity-developer-administrator-responsibilities.md) helps you to better collaborate with your IT Pros.

### Permissions and access

* [Building apps with a Zero Trust approach to identity](identity.md) provides an overview of permissions and access best practices.
* [Supported identity and account types for single- and multi-tenant apps](identity-supported-account-types.md) explains how you can choose if your app allows only users from your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant, any Azure AD tenant, or users with personal Microsoft accounts.
* [Acquiring authorization to access resources](acquire-application-authorization-to-access-resources.md) helps you to understand how to best ensure Zero Trust when acquiring resource access permissions for your application.
* [Developing delegated permissions strategy](developer-strategy-delegated-permission.md) helps you to implement the best approach for managing permissions in your application and develop using Zero Trust principles.
* [Developing application permissions strategy](developer-strategy-application-permissions.md) helps you to decide upon your application permissions approach to credential management.
* [Requesting permissions that require administrative consent](permissions-require-admin-consent.md) describes the permission and consent experience when application permissions will require administrative consent.
* [Reducing overprivileged permissions and apps](overprivileged-permissions.md) helps you to understand why applications shouldn't request more permissions than they need (overprivileged) and how to limit privilege to manage access and improve security.
* [Providing application identity credentials when there's no user](identity-non-user-applications.md) explains why the best Zero Trust client credentials practice for services (non-user applications) on Azure is Managed Identities for Azure resources.
* [API Protection](protect-api.md) describes best practices for protecting your API through registration, defining permissions and consent, and enforcing access to achieve your Zero Trust goals.
* [Calling an API from another API](api-calls-api.md) helps you to ensure Zero Trust when you have one API that needs to call another API and securely develop your application when it's working on behalf of a user.
* [Example of API protected by Microsoft identity consent framework](protected-api-example.md) helps you to design least privilege application permissions strategies for the best user experience.
* [Authorization best practices](developer-strategy-authorization-best-practices.md) helps you to implement the best authorization, permission, and consent models for your applications.

## Zero Trust DevSecOps

* [Securing DevOps environments for Zero Trust](secure-devops-environments-zero-trust.md) describes best practices for securing your DevOps environments with a Zero Trust approach to prevent hackers from compromising developer boxes, infecting release pipelines with malicious scripts, and gaining access to production data via test environments.
* [Securing the DevOps platform environment](secure-devops-platform-environment-zero-trust.md) helps you to implement Zero Trust principles in your DevOps platform environment and highlights best practices for secret and certificate management.
* [Securing the developer environment](secure-dev-environment-zero-trust.md) helps you to implement Zero Trust principles in your development environments with best practices for least privilege, branch security, and trusting tools, extensions, and integrations.
* [Embedding Zero Trust security into your developer workflow](embed-zero-trust-dev-workflow.md) helps you to innovate quickly and securely.
