# DoD Zero Trust Strategy for the data pillar

The [DoD Zero Trust Strategy and Roadmap](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3225919/department-of-defense-releases-zero-trust-strategy-and-roadmap/) outlines a path for Department of Defense components and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) partners to adopt a new cybersecurity framework based on Zero Trust principles. Zero Trust eliminates traditional perimeters and trust assumptions, enabling a more efficient architecture that enhances security, user experiences, and mission performance. 

This guide has recommendations for the 152 Zero Trust activities in the [DoD Zero Trust Capability Execution Roadmap](https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/Library/ZTCapabilitiesActivities.pdf). The sections correspond with the seven pillars of the DoD Zero Trust model.

## 4 Data

This section has Microsoft guidance and recommendations for DoD Zero Trust activities in the data pillar. To learn more, see [Secure data with Zero Trust](/security/zero-trust/deploy/data) for more information.

## 4.1 Data catalog risk alignment

Microsoft Purview solutions help discover, identify, govern, protect, and manage data where it resides. Microsoft Purview provides three to identify items so that they can be classified. Items can be classified manually, by users, via automated pattern recognition, as with sensitive information types, and via machine learning.

## 4.7 Data access control

Microsoft 365 and Azure Storage services are integrated with Microsoft Entra ID for identity-based authorization. Microsoft Entra ID supports role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC).

Microsoft Entra roles and security groups provide organizations role-based access control. Dynamic security groups use attributes defined on user, group, and device objects to define membership, based upon rich expressions and rule sets.

Microsoft Entra ID attribute-based access control utilizes custom security attributes, which are business-specific attributes you can define and assign to Microsoft Entra objects. Custom security attributes store sensitive information. Access to view, or modify, custom security attributes is restricted to Attribute Administrator roles.
