# DoD Zero Trust Strategy for the user pillar

The [DoD Zero Trust Strategy and Roadmap](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3225919/department-of-defense-releases-zero-trust-strategy-and-roadmap/) outlines a path for Department of Defense components and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) partners to adopt a new cybersecurity framework based on Zero Trust principles. Zero Trust eliminates traditional perimeters and trust assumptions, enabling a more efficient architecture that enhances security, user experiences, and mission performance.

This guide has recommendations for the 152 Zero Trust activities in the [DoD Zero Trust Capability Execution Roadmap](https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/Library/ZTCapabilitiesActivities.pdf). The sections correspond with the seven pillars of the DoD Zero Trust model.

## 1.1 User inventory

Microsoft Entra ID is the required identity platform for Microsoft cloud services. Microsoft Entra ID is an identity provider (IdP) and governance platform to support multicloud and hybrid identities. You can use Microsoft Entra ID to govern access to non-Microsoft clouds like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and more. Microsoft Entra ID uses standard identity protocols, making it a suitable IdP for software as a service (SaaS), modern web applications, desktop and mobile apps, also legacy on-premises applications.

Use Microsoft Entra ID to verify users and nonperson entities (NPE), continuously authorize access to apps and data, govern identities and their entitlements following least-privilege principles, and perform just-in-time (JIT) administration.

|DoD Activity Description and Outcome|Microsoft guidance and recommendations|

## 1.2 Conditional user access

Microsoft Entra ID helps your organization implement conditional, dynamic user access. Features that support this capability include Microsoft Entra Conditional Access, Microsoft Entra ID Governance, custom roles, dynamic security groups, app roles, and custom security attributes.

Conditional Access is the real-time Zero Trust policy engine in Microsoft Entra ID. Conditional Access policies use security signals from user, device, application, session, risk, and more to apply adaptive dynamic authorization for resources protected by Microsoft Entra ID.

## 1.4 Privileged access management

Microsoft Entra ID Governance enables PAM features including just-in-time (JIT) administration, entitlement management, and periodic access reviews. Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (PIM) helps you discover how roles are assigned in your organization. Use PIM to convert permanent role assignments JIT, customize role assignment and activation requirements, also schedule access reviews.

Conditional Access enforces authentication strength, risk level, and compliant Privileged Access Workstation (PAW) device for privileged access. Administrative actions in Microsoft Entra ID are recorded in the Microsoft Entra audit logs.

### 1.5 Identity federation and user credentialing

Microsoft Entra ID plays a key role in identity lifecycle management (ILM). A Microsoft Entra tenant is a hyperscale cloud directory service, identity, credential and access management (ICAM) solution, and identity provider (IdP). It supports inter-directory provisioning and app provisioning to manage the lifecycle of internal users in Microsoft Entra ID and other apps.

Microsoft Entra ID Governance features help you manage the access lifecycle for entitlements like apps, Microsoft Teams, and security group membership. Entitlement management can also be used to onboard and govern external guests. You can block access and remove guest user objects when their last access package is removed. To understand how your organization can migrate ILM functions to Microsoft Entra ID, see [Road to the cloud](/entra/architecture/road-to-the-cloud-introduction).

## 1.6 Behavioral, contextual ID, and biometrics

Microsoft Entra ID Protection helps you detect, remediate, and prevent identity threats by using machine learning (ML) and threat intelligence. This feature detects real-time risks during user sign-in and offline risks calculated over time. Risks include token anomalies, unusual sign-in properties, impossible travel, suspicious user behavior, and more.

Identity protection is integrated with Microsoft Defender XDR to show identity risks detected by other components in the Microsoft Defender product family. 

To learn more, see [What are risk detections?](/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks)

## 1.7 Least privileged access

Access to applications using Microsoft Entra ID is deny-by-default. Microsoft Entra ID Governance features like entitlement management and access reviews ensure access is time-bound, aligns to the principle of least privilege, and enforces controls for separation of duties.

Use Microsoft Entra built-in roles to assign least privilege permissions by task. Administrative Units let you scope resource-based permissions for Microsoft Entra ID users and devices.

Microsoft Entra Permissions Management and custom Azure roles help organizations analyze cloud permission use, create, and assign least-privilege roles.

## 1.8 Continuous authentication

Microsoft Entra ID uses short- and long-lived tokens to authenticate users periodically to applications and services that Microsoft Entra protects. Microsoft Entra ID has the Continuous access evaluation (CAE) mechanism to improve the standard protocol. The policy engine responds to environmental changes in near-real-time and enforces adaptive access policies.

|DoD Activity Description and Outcome|Microsoft guidance and recommendations|
|---|---|
|`Target` **1.8.1 Single Authentication**</br>DoD Organizations employ basic authentication processes to authenticate users and NPEs at least once per session (e.g., logon).

## 1.9 Integrated ICAM platform

Microsoft Entra ID supports certificate authentication with certificates issued by an external public key infrastructure (PKI) for user and nonperson entities (NPE). NPEs in Microsoft Entra ID are application and device identities. Microsoft Entra External ID cross-tenant access settings help multitenant organizations, like the DoD, collaborate seamlessly across tenants.

|DoD Activity Description and Outcome|Microsoft guidance and recommendations|
|---|---|
|`Target` **1.9.1 Enterprise PKI/IDP Pt1**</br>The DoD Enterprise works with Organizations to implement Enterprise Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Identity Provider (IdP) solutions in a centralized and/or federated fashion.
