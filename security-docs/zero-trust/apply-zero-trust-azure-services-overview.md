Writers note:

For updates to product names, please also update the appropriate figures.

To update figures that are not screen shots, your options are:

- Locate the source Visio file in internal storage (ask your publishing contacts about the Illustration-locations.docx document) (highly recommended).
- Use a published Visio file in the Microsoft Download Center (see the https://learn.microsoft.com/security/zero-trust/zero-trust-tech-illus article for all the downloads).
- For figures that are published in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format, save the SVG file from the article web page, insert into Visio, modify, and then save it as a new version of the SVG file (last resort).

For updates to figures that are included in download files (see the https://learn.microsoft.com/security/zero-trust/zero-trust-tech-illus article for all the downloads), please: 

- Update the corresponding files (Visio, PowerPoint, PDF) as needed.
- Publish the Visio and PDF files in the Microsoft Download Center and update the refresh date (such as March 2024) for the download in this article and the https://learn.microsoft.com/security/zero-trust/zero-trust-tech-illus article.

For new articles in this content set, please:

- Add cross-links in the "Next steps" section FROM all the other articles in this content set TO the new article.
- Add a link to the Zero Trust Guidance Center page (index.yml).
- Update the "Content architecture" figure in the apply-zero-trust-azure-services-overview.md article as needed.

# Overview – Apply Zero Trust principles to Azure services

**Summary:** To apply Zero Trust principles to Azure services, you need to determine the set of infrastructure components required to support your desired workload, and then apply Zero Trust principles to those components.

This series of articles helps you apply the [principles of Zero Trust](zero-trust-overview.md) to your services in Microsoft Azure using a multi-disciplinary methodology. Zero Trust is a security strategy. It is not a product or a service, but an approach in designing and implementing the following set of security principles:

- Verify explicitly
- Use least privileged access
- Assume breach

Implementing the Zero Trust “never trust, always verify” approach requires changes to cloud infrastructure, deployment strategy, and implementation.

These articles show you how to apply Zero Trust approach to these new or already deployed Azure services:

- [Azure IaaS overview](azure-infrastructure-overview.md)
  - [Azure storage](azure-infrastructure-storage.md)
  - [Virtual machines](azure-infrastructure-virtual-machines.md)
  - [Spoke virtual networks](azure-infrastructure-iaas.md)
  - [Spoke virtual networks with Azure PaaS services](azure-infrastructure-paas.md)
  - [Hub virtual networks](azure-infrastructure-networking.md)
- [Azure Virtual Desktop](azure-infrastructure-avd.md)
- [Azure Virtual WAN](azure-virtual-wan.md)
- [IaaS applications in Amazon Web Services](secure-iaas-apps.md)
- [Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender XDR](/security/operations/siem-xdr-overview)

## Content architecture

Here is the content architecture for this set of articles that contain the set of platform and workload articles to apply Zero Trust principles to Azure services.

:::image type="content" source="media/apply-zero-trust-azure-services-overview/content-architecture.svg" alt-text="The stack diagram for the set of articles that describe how you apply Zero Trust to Azure services, starting at the bottom of the stack and moving up to the desired workload." lightbox="media/apply-zero-trust-azure-services-overview/content-architecture.svg":::

You apply the guidance in the articles in a stack from the bottom up.

| Workload | Platform set of articles (from the bottom up) |
| --- | --- |
| IaaS apps in Amazon Web Services (AWS) | <ul><li> Cloud identity infrastructure </li><li> Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender XDR </li></ul> |
| Spoke VNet with Azure IaaS services | <ul><li> Cloud identity infrastructure </li><li> Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender XDR </li><li> Hub VNets (traditional) OR Azure Virtual WAN (Microsoft-managed) </li><li> Storage </li></ul> |
| Azure Virtual Desktop or virtual machines | <ul><li> Cloud identity infrastructure </li><li> Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender XDR </li><li> Hub VNets (traditional) OR Azure Virtual WAN (Microsoft-managed) </li><li> Storage </li><li> Spoke VNet with Azure IaaS services </li></ul>  |

It’s important to note that the guidance in this series of articles is more specific for this type of architecture than the guidance provided in the [Cloud Adoption Framework](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/get-started/index) and [Azure landing zone](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/index) architectures. If you have applied the guidance in either of these resources, be sure to also review this series of articles for additional recommendations.
