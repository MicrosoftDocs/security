# Step 1. Explicitly validate trust for all access requests

Your first step is to establish a security perimeter for cloud applications and mobile devices that uses identity as the control plane and explicitly validates trust for user accounts and devices before allowing access, for both public and private networks.

This includes using Zero Trust to explicitly validate trust for all access requests for:

- [Identities](#identities)
- [Endpoints (devices)](#endpoints)
- [Apps](#apps)
- [Network](#network)

After completing this step, you will have built out this part of the Zero Trust architecture.

## Identities

Verify and secure each identity with strong authentication across your entire digital estate with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), a complete identity and access management solution with integrated security that connects 425 million people to their apps, devices, and data each month.

## Apps

Because apps are used by malicious users to infiltrate your organization, you need to ensure that your apps are using services, such as Azure AD and Intune, that provide Zero Trust protection or are hardened against attack.

This table describes a Zero Trust implementation for apps in terms of a sponsorship/program management/project management hierarchy to determine and drive results.

| Lead | Owner | Accountability |

| | Security Governance | Monitor to ensure compliance |

### Deployment objectives

Meet these deployment objectives to ensure Zero Trust protection for your SaaS, PaaS, and on-premises apps.

| Done | Type of app or app usage | Deployment objectives | Owner | Documentation |
|:-------|:-------|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| <input type="checkbox" /> | SaaS and PaaS apps that are part of your Microsoft cloud subscriptions | Use Azure AD app registration and certification and app consent policies. <br>  Use Azure AD Conditional Access policies and Intune MAM and Application Protection Policies (APP) policies to allow app usage. | Identity Architect | [Application management in Azure AD](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-application-management)  |
| <input type="checkbox" /> | Apps in your Microsoft cloud subscriptions that are OAuth-enabled and access Microsoft 365 data through the Graph APIs | Use the app governance add-on to Defender for Cloud Apps for app behavior visibility, governance with policy enforcement, and detection and remediation of app-based attacks. | Security Engineer | [Overview](/defender-cloud-apps/app-governance-manage-app-governance) |
| <input type="checkbox" /> | SaaS and PaaS apps that are **NOT** part of your Microsoft cloud subscriptions | Ensure that they are using Azure AD for authentication. This means that all sign-ins to the app are subject to user and device security requirements such as multifactor authentication and meeting defined requirements for device compliance. | Apps Architect | [Integrating all your apps with Azure AD](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/five-steps-to-full-application-integration-with-azure-ad) |
| <input type="checkbox" /> | On-premises users accessing on-premises applications, which includes applications running on both on-premises and IaaS-based servers | Ensure that your apps support modern authentication protocols such as OAuth/OIDC and SAML. Contact your application vendor for updates to protect user sign-in. | Identity Architect | See your vendor documentation |
| <input type="checkbox" /> | Remote users accessing on-premises applications through a VPN connection | Configure your VPN appliance so that it uses Azure AD as its identity provider | Network Architect | See your vendor documentation |
| <input type="checkbox" /> | Remote users accessing on-premises **web** applications through a VPN connection | Publish the applications through Azure AD Application Proxy. Remote users only need to access the individual published application, which is routed to the on-premises web server through an application proxy connector. <br><br> Connections take advantage of strong Azure AD authentication and limits users and their devices to accessing a single application at a time. In contrast, the scope of a typical remote access VPN is all locations, protocols, and ports of the entire on-premises network. | Cloud Network Architect | [Remote access to on-premises applications through Azure AD Application Proxy](/azure/active-directory/app-proxy/application-proxy) |


After completing these deployment objectives, you will have built out the **Apps** section of the Zero Trust architecture.

## Network

The Zero Trust model assumes breach and verifies each request as though it originated from an uncontrolled network. Although this is a common practice for public networks, it also applies to your organization’s internal networks which are generally firewalled from the public Internet.

To adhere to Zero Trust, your organization must address security vulnerabilities on both public and private networks, whether on-premises or in the cloud, and ensure that you verify explicitly, use least privilege access, and assume breach. Devices, users, and apps are not to be inherently trusted because they are on your private networks.
