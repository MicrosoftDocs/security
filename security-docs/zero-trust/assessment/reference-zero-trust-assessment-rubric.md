# Zero Trust assessment rubric

Each recommendation in the Zero Trust guidelines includes a rating for three areas: **Risk Level**, **User Impact**, and **Implementation Cost**. The rating uses the rubric in this article. 

## Risk Level

| Risk Level | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **High**       | There's a potential for environment-wide exposure to threats until you mitigate the issue. |
| **Medium**     | There's a potential for moderate exposure to threats until you mitigate the issue. |
| **Low**        | Mitigation is a defense in depth or an operational optimization. |

## User Impact 

| User Impact | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **High**        | A large number of nonprivileged users need to take action or get notified about changes. |
| **Medium**      | A subset of nonprivileged users need to take action or get notified about changes. |
| **Low**         | Administrators can take action. Users don't need to get notified. |

## Implementation Cost 

| Implementation Cost | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **High**                | Customer IT and Secops teams need to implement programs that require ongoing time or resource commitment from IT teams. |
| **Medium**              | Customer IT and Secops teams need to drive projects. |
| **Low**                 | Customer IT and Secops teams need to execute targeted actions. |
