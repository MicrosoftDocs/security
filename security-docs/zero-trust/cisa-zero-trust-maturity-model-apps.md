Establish policy to use Microsoft Entra ID for new applications. Authorize application access with user and group assignment to applications. Microsoft Entra ID implements industry-standard protocols, when combined with Microsoft Entra Conditional Access. Incorporate contextual information per request with an expiration.  </br> - [Integrate Microsoft Entra ID and apps](/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/plan-an-application-integration) </br> - [Tokens and claims](/entra/identity-platform/security-tokens) </br> - [Assign users and groups to an app](/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal) </br></br>**Conditional Access**</br>Use device signals such as location in Conditional Access policies for security decisions.

GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps is an application security testing service native to developer workflows.</br> - [Code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/introduction-to-code-scanning/about-code-scanning-with-codeql) </br> - [GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/devops/github-advanced-security)</br></br>**Software bill of materials generation tool**</br> Use the build-time SBOM generator that works across operating systems: Windows, Linux, and MacOS. It uses the standard Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) format.</br> - [Open sourced SBOM generation tool](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/engineering-at-microsoft/microsoft-open-sources-software-bill-of-materials-sbom-generation-tool/) </br> - [SBOM tool on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/sbom-tool)</br></br>|
|**Advanced Maturity Status**</br></br>Enterprise implements tiered, tailored policies enterprise wide for applications and all aspects of the application development and deployment lifecycles and leverages automation, where possible, to support enforcement. |**Azure Policy**</br> Help enforce standards and assess compliance. See the compliance dashboard for an aggregated view of the environment.</br> [Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/overview)</br></br>**Microsoft Defender for Cloud**</br> Protect Azure and non-Azure workloads with Defender for Cloud. Use regulatory compliance and Azure Policy to assess infrastructure continuously with configuration standards. Prevent configurational drift.</br> - [Assign security standards](/azure/defender-for-cloud/update-regulatory-compliance-packages) </br> - [Multicloud environments](/azure/defender-for-cloud/multicloud)</br></br>**Management groups**</br> Use management groups to help enforce access policies and compliance for Azure subscriptions.</br> [Subscriptions and management groups](/azure/governance/management-groups/manage)</br></br>|
|**Optimal Maturity Status**</br></br>Enterprise fully automates policies governing applications development and deployment, including incorporating dynamic updates for applications through the CI/CD pipeline. |**Defender for Cloud**</br>Deploy monitoring components to collect data from Azure workloads and monitor vulnerabilities and threats.</br> - [Defender for Cloud](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction) </br> - [Data collection from workloads](/azure/defender-for-cloud/monitoring-components) </br></br> Policy in Defender for Cloud consists of standards and recommendations to help improve your cloud security posture. Standards define rules, compliance conditions for those rules, and actions when conditions aren't met.</br> [Security policy](/azure/defender-for-cloud/security-policy-concept)</br></br>**Infrastructure as Code**</br> Use continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) to deploy IaC with GitHub Actions.</br> [Azure infrastructure with GitHub Actions](/devops/deliver/iac-github-actions) </br></br>**Azure Policy**</br>To deploy Azure Policy as code define, test, and deploy its definitions.</br> [Policy as code workflows](/azure/governance/policy/concepts/policy-as-code) </br></br>|
