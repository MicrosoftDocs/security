# User access and productivity

To be productive, your employees (users) must be able to use:

- Their account credentials to verify their identity.
- Their endpoint (device), such as a PC, tablet, or phone.
- The applications you have provided them to do their jobs. 
- A network over which traffic flows between them and either on-premises or cloud applications.

Each one of these elements are the targets of attackers and must be protected with the "never trust, always verify" central principle of Zero Trust.

## Next step

Begin the user access and productivity initiative with [Step 1. Explicitly validate trust for all access requests](user-access-productivity-validate-trust.md).
