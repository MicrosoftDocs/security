# Secure networks with Zero Trust

Network security changed a lot in recent years. Instead of relying on a single perimeter, organizations now use risk-based policies to control both internal and external traffic. This means isolating hosts, enforcing encryption, segmenting networks, and improving visibility across the enterprise. Security controls are now placed closer to applications and data, making it easier to protect resources and respond to threats. Each application can have its own security settings based on its specific needs for access and connectivity.

The emergence of SASE represents a paradigm shift in how organizations approach network security. SASE converges networking and security functions into a single, unified service. SASE offers a more streamlined and effective way to protect data and applications, regardless of where they're located. This modern approach not only simplifies the management of security policies but also enhances the overall security posture of the organization. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is playing a pivotal role in this new era of network security. AI-driven solutions are capable of analyzing vast amounts of data in real-time, identifying potential threats, and responding to incidents with unprecedented speed and accuracy. By applying AI, organizations can proactively detect and mitigate security risks, ensuring a more robust and resilient network infrastructure.

In summary, the adoption of SASE, coupled with the integration of AI, marks a significant advancement in the field of network security. These innovations are enabling organizations to stay ahead of emerging threats and maintain a secure and efficient network environment.

## Key Principles of the Zero Trust Network Model

Instead of assuming that everything behind the corporate firewall is secure, an end-to-end Zero Trust strategy acknowledges that breaches are inevitable. This approach requires verifying each request as if it originates from an uncontrolled network, with identity management playing a crucial role. When organizations incorporate the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Zero Trust models and patterns, they enhance their security posture and better protect their networks.

In the Zero Trust model, there are three key objectives when it comes to securing your networks:

- Be ready to handle attacks before they happen.
- Minimize the extent of the damage and how fast it spreads.
- Increase the difficulty of compromising your cloud footprint.

To make this happen, follow three Zero Trust principles:

- **Verify explicitly.** Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points. Include user identity, location, device health, service or workload, user and device risk, data classification, and anomalies.
- **Use least-privileged access.** Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection to protect both data and productivity.
- **Assume breach.** Minimize influence radius for breaches and prevent lateral movement by segmenting access by network, user, devices, and application awareness. Verify all sessions are encrypted end to end. Use analytics to get [visibility](https://aka.ms/ZTCrossPillars), drive threat detection, and improve defenses.


## Zero Trust network deployment objectives

Before most organizations start their Zero Trust journey, they have network security that is characterized as:
- Minimal or no identity awareness for network traffic.
- Limited or no risk based policy decision capabilities.
- Limited or no governance or lifecycle for application access.

Zero Trust (ZT) is a security model that assumes no implicit trust and continuously verifies every access request. The Network Pillar in Zero Trust focuses on securing communications, segmenting environments, and enforcing least privilege access to resources.

When implementing an end-to-end Zero Trust framework for securing networks, we recommend you focus first on [objectives 1 through 4](#1-network-segmentation--software-defined-perimeters). After these objectives are completed, focus on [objectives 5 through 7](#7-discontinue-legacy-network-security-technology).

## Zero Trust networking deployment guide

This guide walks you through the steps required to secure your networks following the principles of a Zero Trust security framework.

### 1. Network-Segmentation & Software-Defined Perimeters

Network segmentation and Software-Defined Perimeters (SDP) form the foundation of the Zero Trust security model. Instead of relying on static, perimeter-based controls, you enforce security dynamically at the resource level. When you partition your infrastructure into isolated segments using micro-segmentation, you restrict attackersâ€™ lateral movement and minimize the effect of breaches. SDP strengthens this approach by creating on-demand, identity-centric "micro-perimeters" around each user-resource interaction and continuously validating context before granting access. In summary, follow these key principles:

- Restrict lateral movement by implementing fine-grained network segmentation (Macro & Micro segmentation).
- Utilize Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Access Control (NAC) to dynamically enforce policies.
- Adopt identity-based segmentation over traditional IP-based methods.

#### 1.1 Macro segmentation strategy

Before diving into micro-segmentation, it's essential to establish a broader segmentation strategy. Macro segmentation involves dividing your network into larger segments based on overarching functional or security requirements. This approach simplifies initial management and provides a foundation upon which finer granularity, like micro-segmentation, can be built. 

#### 1.2 Network segmentation: Many ingress/egress cloud micro-perimeters with some micro-segmentation

Organizations shouldn't just have one single, large pipe in and out of their network. In a Zero Trust approach, networks are instead segmented into smaller islands where specific workloads are contained. Each segment has its own ingress and egress controls to minimize the effect of unauthorized access to data. By implementing software-defined perimeters with granular controls, you increase the difficulty for unauthorized actors to propagate throughout your network, and so reduce the lateral movement of threats.

There's no architecture design that fits the needs of all organizations. You have the option between a few [common design patterns](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/06/15/zero-trust-part-1-networking/) for segmenting your network according to the Zero Trust model.

In this deployment guide, we walk you through the steps to achieve one of those designs: Micro-segmentation.

With micro-segmentation, organizations can move beyond simple centralized network-based perimeters to comprehensive and distributed segmentation using software-defined micro-perimeters.

#### 1.3 Network segmentation: Fully distributed ingress/egress cloud micro-perimeters and deeper micro-segmentation

Once you accomplish your initial three objectives, the next step is to further segment your network.

#### 1.4 Segment and enforce the external boundaries

:::image type="content" source="../media/diagram-servers-devices-boundaries-azure-vpn.png" alt-text="Diagram of servers and devices with connections across boundaries." border="true":::

Follow these steps, depending on the type of boundary:

##### Internet boundary

- To provide internet connectivity for your application route via the virtual network hub, [update the network security group rules](/azure/virtual-network/tutorial-filter-network-traffic) in virtual network hub.
- To protect the virtual network hub from volumetric network layer attacks and protocol attacks, [turn on Azure DDoS Network Protection](/azure/virtual-network/manage-ddos-protection#enable-ddos-for-an-existing-virtual-network).
    
- If your application uses HTTP/S protocols, [turn on Azure Web Application Firewall](/azure/web-application-firewall/afds/waf-front-door-custom-rules-powershell) to protect against Layer 7 threats.


##### On-premises boundary

- If your app needs connectivity to your on-premises data center or private cloud, use [Microsoft Entra Private Access](/azure/global-secure-access/), [Azure ExpressRoute](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager), or [Azure VPN for connectivity to your virtual network hub](/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-site-to-site-resource-manager-portal). 
- To inspect and govern traffic in the virtual network hub, [Configure the Azure Firewall](/azure/firewall/tutorial-hybrid-ps).


##### PaaS services boundary

 - When using Azure-provided PaaS services, (Azure Storage, [Azure Cosmos DB](/azure/private-link/create-private-endpoint-cosmosdb-portal),
    or [Azure Web App](/azure/private-link/create-private-endpoint-webapp-portal), use the [PrivateLink](/azure/private-link/create-private-link-service-portal) connectivity option to ensure all data exchanges are over the private IP space and the traffic never leaves the Microsoft network.

##### Partition app components to different subnets

:::image type="content" source="../media/diagram-azure-region-virtual-network-servers.png" alt-text="Diagram of a virtual network of servers in the Azure region." border="true":::


Follow these steps:

- Within the virtual network, [add virtual network subnets](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-manage-subnet) so that discrete components of an application can have their own perimeters.
- To allow traffic only from the subnets that have an app subcomponent identified as a legitimate communications counterpart, [apply network security group rules](/azure/virtual-network/tutorial-filter-network-traffic#create-security-rules).

##### Applications are partitioned to different Azure Virtual Networks (VNets) and connected using a hub-spoke model

:::image type="content" source="../media/diagram-network-hub-spoke-two-regions.png" alt-text="Diagram of two virtual networks connected in a hub-and-spoke model." border="false":::

Follow these steps:

- [Create dedicated virtual networks](/azure/virtual-network/quick-create-portal) for different applications and/or application components.

- Create a central virtual network to set up the security posture for inter-app connectivity and connect the app VNets in [a hub-and-spoke architecture](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/hub-spoke).

- [Deploy Azure Firewall](/azure/firewall/deploy-ps) in the virtual network hub. Use Azure Firewall to inspect and govern network traffic.



### 2. Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) & Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)

To effectively secure modern networks, organizations must move beyond legacy solutions and adopt advanced, integrated approaches. The move includes adopting Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) solutions for granular, identity-driven connectivity, applying Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) architectures to unify networking and security capabilities, and implementing continuous session validation with risk-based access controls. These strategies work together to ensure that access is always verified, threats are minimized, and security policies adapt dynamically to evolving risks.

#### 2.1 Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)

Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) replaces traditional perimeter-based VPN models with a granular, identity-aware, and risk-adaptive approach. Instead of granting broad network access, ZTNA enforces least-privilege connectivity to specific applications and resources based on user identity, device posture, and contextual signals.

Microsoftâ€™s implementation of ZTNA is part of the Global Secure Access (preview) capability under Microsoft Entra, built on the Security Service Edge (SSE) foundation.  
[Learn more: What is Global Secure Access? (Microsoft Entra)](/entra/global-secure-access/overview-what-is-global-secure-access)

##### Modernize Traditional VPNs with Identity-Aware ZTNA

Traditional VPNs grant broad, flat access to the networkâ€”violating Zero Trust principles. With Microsoft's Global Secure Access:

- **Access is app-specific, not network-wide.**
- **Policies are enforced at the connection edge,** driven by Entra ID identity, device compliance, and risk.
- **Leverages Private Access,** part of Global Secure Access, to securely connect users to on-premises, or IaaS-hosted applications without exposing the network.

[Use Private Access in Global Secure Access](/entra/global-secure-access/concept-private-access)

**Key capabilities:**

- Microsoft Entra Conditional Access enforcement at session start
- Native device posture integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- TLS-based tunnels for secure outbound-only connections (no inbound exposure)

##### Use SASE Architecture: Integrate Networking & Security Functions

Microsoft Global Secure Access integrates Security Service Edge (SSE) capabilities into a SASE-aligned framework, combining secure access and inspection in one unified platform.

**Key integrated services:**

- **Secure Web Gateway (SWG):** Outbound internet traffic filtering and logging  
    [What is Microsoft Entra Internet Access Secure Web Gateway (SWG)?](/entra/global-secure-access/concept-internet-access)
- **Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB):** App discovery, session controls, and DLP via Defender for Cloud Apps  
    [Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)](/defender-cloud-apps/what-is-defender-for-cloud-apps)
- **Firewall as a Service (FWaaS):** Integration with Azure Firewall and Defender for Cloud

This architecture:

- Routes user traffic through Microsoftâ€™s edge network, applying inspection and control
- Reduces complexity by centralizing security policy enforcement
- Supports steering and split tunneling for performance and compliance

##### Implement Continuous Session Validation & Risk-Based Access

ZTNA isn't a one-time check. It requires continuous evaluation of session trustworthiness.

Microsoft Global Secure Access and Microsoft Entra provide:

- **Continuous access evaluation (CAE):** Revoke or modify access in real time when risk conditions change  
    [What is Continuous Access Evaluation?](/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-continuous-access-evaluation)
- **Integration with Microsoft Defender XDR and Sentinel:** Detect threats and feed into adaptive policy responses
- **Real-time session controls:** Use Defender for Cloud Apps for in-browser policy enforcement (for example, block downloads)  
    [Use session controls in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/defender-cloud-apps/session-policy-aad)

The solutions let's you:

- Terminate risky sessions or force reauthentication
- Apply policies dynamically based on signals like location, malware detection, or token anomalies
- Maintain full audit visibility for every session decision


### 3. Strong Encryption & Secure Communication

- Use Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3+ and end-to-end encryption for all network traffic.
- Enforce mutual authentication (mTLS) between workloads and devices.
- Block untrusted or legacy protocols that lack encryption.

#### 3.1 Encryption: User-to-app internal traffic is encrypted

Add encryption to ensure user-to-app internal traffic is encrypted.

Follow these steps:

- Enforce HTTPS-only communication for your internet facing web applications by [redirecting HTTP traffic to HTTPS using Azure Front Door](/azure/frontdoor/front-door-how-to-redirect-https).
- Connect remote employees/partners to Microsoft Azure using the [Azure VPN Gateway](/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways).
    - [Turn on encryption](/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-security-controls#data-protection) for any point-to-site traffic in Azure VPN Gateway service.
- Access your Azure virtual machines securely using encrypted communication via [Azure Bastion](/azure/bastion/bastion-overview).
- [Connect using SSH to a Linux virtual machine](/azure/bastion/bastion-connect-vm-ssh).
- [Connect using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to a Windows virtual machine](/azure/bastion/bastion-connect-vm-rdp).

> [!TIP]
> [Learn about implementing an end-to-end Zero Trust strategy for applications](https://aka.ms/ZTApplications).

#### 3.2 Encryption: All traffic

Finally, complete your network protection by ensuring that all traffic is encrypted.

Follow these steps:

- [Encrypt application backend traffic](/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-ipsecikepolicy-rm-powershell) between virtual networks.
- Encrypt traffic between on-premises and cloud:
    - [Configure a site-to-site VPN](/azure/expressroute/site-to-site-vpn-over-microsoft-peering) over ExpressRoute Microsoft peering.
    - [Configure IPsec transport mode](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-howto-ipsec-transport-private-windows) for ExpressRoute private peering.
    - Configure mTLS between servers across ExpressRoute private peering.

### 4. Network Visibility & Threat Detection

- Deploy Network Detection & Response (NDR) to monitor and analyze network traffic.
- Use DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) and AI-driven anomaly detection for real-time threat hunting.
- Maintain a centralized logging and SIEM/SOAR integration for network analysis.
- Deploy Extended Detection and Response (XDR) to analyze traffic patterns, identify anomalies, and prevent breaches.
- Integrate AI-driven analytics to enhance rapid responses to emerging threats.

#### 4.1 Threat protection: Machine learning-based threat protection and filtering with context-based signals

For further threat protection, turn on [Azure DDoS Protection Standard](/azure/virtual-network/ddos-protection-overview) to constantly monitor your Azure-hosted application traffic, use ML-based frameworks to baseline and detect volumetric traffic floods, and apply automatic mitigations.

Follow these steps:

- [Configure and manage](/azure/virtual-network/manage-ddos-protection) Azure DDoS Network Protection.
- [Configure alerts](/azure/virtual-network/manage-ddos-protection#configure-alerts-for-ddos-protection-metrics) for DDoS protection metrics.


#### 4.2 Threat protection: Cloud native filtering and protection for known threats

Cloud applications that open endpoints to external environments, such as the internet or your on-premises footprint, are at risk of attacks coming in from those environments. It's therefore imperative that you scan the traffic for malicious payloads or logic.

These types of threats fall into two broad categories:

- **Known attacks**. Threats discovered by your software provider or the larger community. In such cases, the attack signature is available and you need to ensure that each request is checked against those signatures. The key is to be able to quickly update your detection engine with any newly identified attacks.

- **Unknown attacks.** These attacks are threats that don't quite match against any known signature. These types of threats include zero-day vulnerabilities and unusual patterns in request traffic. The ability to detect such attacks depends on how well your defenses know what's normal and what isn't. Your defenses should be constantly learning and updating such patterns as your business (and associated traffic) evolves.

Take these steps to protect against known threats:

- Implement Microsoft Entra Internet Access capabilities.

- **For endpoints with HTTP/S traffic**, protect using [Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF)](/azure/web-application-firewall/overview) by:

    - Turning on the default ruleset or [OWASP top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) protection ruleset to protect against known web-layer attacks

    - Turning on the bot protection ruleset to prevent malicious bots from scraping information, conducting credential stuffing, etc.

    - Adding custom rules to protect against threats specific to your business.

    You can use one of two options:

    - [Azure Front Door](/azure/frontdoor/front-door-overview)

        - [Create a Web Application Firewall policy on Azure Front Door](/azure/web-application-firewall/afds/waf-front-door-create-portal).

        - [Configure bot protection for Web Application Firewall](/azure/web-application-firewall/afds/waf-front-door-policy-configure-bot-protection).

        - [Custom rules for Web Application Firewall](/azure/web-application-firewall/afds/waf-front-door-custom-rules-powershell).

    - [Azure Application Gateway](/azure/application-gateway/overview)

       - [Create an application gateway with a Web Application Firewall](/azure/web-application-firewall/ag/application-gateway-web-application-firewall-portal).

       - [Configure bot protection for Web Application Firewall](/azure/web-application-firewall/ag/bot-protection).

       - [Create and use Web Application Firewall v2 custom rules.](/azure/web-application-firewall/ag/create-custom-waf-rules).


- **For all endpoints (HTTP or not)**, front with [Azure Firewall](/azure/firewall/overview) for threat intelligence-based filtering at Layer 4:

    - [Deploy and configure Azure Firewall](/azure/firewall/tutorial-firewall-deploy-portal) using the Azure portal.
    - [Enable threat intelligence-based filtering](/azure/firewall/threat-intel) for your traffic.

### 5. Policy-Driven Access Control & Least Privilege

Modern Zero Trust networks require granular, adaptive access controls that enforce least privilege and respond dynamically to risk. Policy-driven access ensures users and devices only get the minimum permissions needed, for the shortest time required, and only under the right conditions.

#### 5.1 Implement Context-Aware Access Policies

- Use Microsoft Entra Conditional Access to define policies based on user, device, location, application, and risk signals.
- Start by [planning your Conditional Access deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/plan-conditional-access) to align policies with your organizational requirements.
- Accelerate deployment with [Conditional Access policy templates](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/howto-policy-templates) for common scenarios.

#### 5.2 Enforce Risk-Based and Adaptive Controls

- Require multifactor authentication (MFA) when risk is detected, such as unfamiliar sign-ins or risky devices.
- Leverage [sign-in risk-based MFA](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-risk) to automatically prompt for MFA based on real-time risk assessment.
- Understand [risk detections in Microsoft Entra ID Protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-protection/overview-identity-protection) to inform policy decisions and automate remediation.

#### 5.3 Apply Just-in-Time (JIT) and Privileged Access

- Enforce Just-in-Time (JIT) access using Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to grant elevated permissions only when needed.
- [Secure private application access with PIM and Global Secure Access](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-pim-private-access) to reduce standing privileges and limit exposure.

#### 5.4 Hybrid and Application-Specific Access

- For hybrid environments, configure per-app access policies using [Global Secure Access Applications](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-applications).
- Enable secure remote administration by [using SSH with Microsoft Entra Private Access](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-ssh-private-access) for granular, policy-driven server access.

#### 5.5 Deny-by-Default and Continuous Evaluation

- Apply deny-by-default principles at all network layers, granting access only when explicitly allowed by policy.
- Continuously evaluate session risk and enforce policy changes in real time to minimize attack surface.

By combining context-aware, risk-adaptive, and least-privilege policies, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and lateral movement within their networks.


### 6. Cloud & Hybrid Network Security

Securing cloud and hybrid environments requires a combination of modern, cloud-native controls and consistent policy enforcement across all platforms. As organizations adopt multi-cloud and hybrid architectures, it's essential to extend Zero Trust principles beyond traditional data centers to cloud workloads, SaaS, and PaaS environments.

#### 6.1 Secure Cloud Workloads with Micro-Perimeters and Cloud-Native Firewalls

- **Micro-perimeters:** Use micro-segmentation to create granular security boundaries around individual workloads, applications, or services. This limits lateral movement and contains potential breaches within isolated segments.
- **Cloud-native firewalls:** Deploy solutions like [Azure Firewall](/azure/firewall/overview) to inspect and control traffic between cloud workloads, enforce threat intelligence-based filtering, and apply application and network rules at scale.
- **Network Security Groups (NSGs):** Use NSGs and [Application Security Groups](/azure/virtual-network/application-security-groups) to define and enforce fine-grained access controls for resources within virtual networks.
- **Private endpoints:** Leverage [Azure Private Link](/azure/private-link/private-link-overview) to restrict access to PaaS services over private IP addresses, ensuring traffic stays within the trusted Microsoft backbone.

#### 6.2 Integrate Identity-Aware Proxies for SaaS and PaaS Security

- **Identity-aware proxies:** Implement solutions such as [Microsoft Entra Private Access](/entra/global-secure-access/concept-private-access) to broker access to SaaS and PaaS applications. These proxies enforce authentication, device compliance, and Conditional Access policies before granting access.
- **Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB):** Use [Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/defender-cloud-apps/what-is-defender-for-cloud-apps) to discover, monitor, and control SaaS usage, enforce data loss prevention (DLP), and apply session controls for cloud applications.
- **Continuous session validation:** Apply risk-based, real-time policy enforcement for SaaS and PaaS access, including adaptive controls based on user, device, and session context.

#### 6.3 Ensure Consistent Security Policy Enforcement Across Hybrid and Multicloud Environments

- **Unified policy management:** Use platforms like [Microsoft Entra Conditional Access](/entra/identity/conditional-access/overview) and [Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/overview) to define and enforce consistent security policies across on-premises, Azure, and other cloud providers.
- **Hybrid connectivity:** Secure hybrid connections using [Azure VPN Gateway](/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways), [ExpressRoute](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction), and enforce encryption and access controls for all cross-environment traffic.
- **Centralized monitoring and response:** Integrate logs and security events from all environments into [Microsoft Sentinel](/azure/sentinel/overview) or your SIEM/SOAR platform for unified visibility, threat detection, and automated response.
- **Multicloud security posture management:** Use tools like [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction) to assess, monitor, and improve the security posture of resources across Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud.

By implementing these strategies, organizations can achieve robust, end-to-end security for cloud and hybrid networks, ensuring Zero Trust principles are consistently applied regardless of where workloads and data reside.


### 7. Discontinue legacy network security technology

Discontinue the use of signature-based Network Intrusion Detection/Network Intrusion Prevention (NIDS/NIPS) Systems and Network Data Leakage/Loss Prevention (DLP).

The major cloud service providers already filter for malformed packets and common network layer attacks, so there's no need for a NIDS/NIPS solution to detect the attacks. In addition, traditional NIDS/NIPS solutions typically use signature-based approaches (which are considered outdated) and attackers easily evade them. Signature-based approaches produce a high rate of false positives.

Network-based DLP is decreasingly effective at identifying both inadvertent and deliberate data loss. The reason for this is that most modern protocols and attackers use network-level encryption for inbound and outbound communications. The only viable workaround is `SSL-bridging` which provides an "authorized man-in-the-middle" that terminates and then reestablishes encrypted network connections. The `SSL-bridging` approach is out of favor because of the level of trust required for the partner running the solution and the technologies that are being used.

Based on this rationale, we offer an all-up recommendation that you discontinue use of these legacy network security technologies. However, if your organizational experience is that these technologies prevent and detect real attacks, consider porting them to your cloud environment.
