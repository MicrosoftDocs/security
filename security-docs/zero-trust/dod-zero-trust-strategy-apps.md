# DoD Zero Trust Strategy for the applications and workloads pillar

The [DoD Zero Trust Strategy and Roadmap](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3225919/department-of-defense-releases-zero-trust-strategy-and-roadmap/) outlines a path for Department of Defense components and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) partners to adopt a new cybersecurity framework based on Zero Trust principles. Zero Trust eliminates traditional perimeters and trust assumptions, enabling a more efficient architecture that enhances security, user experiences, and mission performance. 

This guide has recommendations for the 152 Zero Trust activities in the [DoD Zero Trust Capability Execution Roadmap](https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/Library/ZTCapabilitiesActivities.pdf). The sections correspond with the seven pillars of the DoD Zero Trust model.

## 3.1 Application inventory

Microsoft Entra ID is an identity provider (IdP) for applications and cloud platforms, not just Microsoft 365, and Azure. Microsoft Entra ID includes web portals and RESTful APIs to retrieve lists of integrated applications. 
Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, a component of Microsoft Defender XDR, has features to discover, inventory, and block unsanctioned apps.

## 3.2 Secure software development and integration

GitHub features like GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) and GitHub Actions help you establish Zero Trust software development and deployment practices. GitHub Enterprise Cloud integrates with Microsoft Entra ID to manage entitlement with Microsoft Entra ID Governance and secure access with Conditional Access policies. 

Developers can use Microsoft Authentication Libraries (MSAL) to integrate applications with Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, see [Authenticate users for Zero Trust](/security/zero-trust/develop/user-authentication).

Part one (1) of this activity includes the integration of a Secure API gateway with applications utilizing API or similar calls. Code reviews are conducted in a methodical approach and standardized protections for containers and their infrastructure are in place. Additionally, any serverless functions where the third-party manages the infrastructure such as Platform as a Service utilize adequate serverless security monitoring and response functions.

## 3.4 Resource authorization and integration

Conditional Access is the Zero Trust policy engine in Microsoft Entra ID. Connect your application workloads with Microsoft Entra ID. Use Microsoft Entra ID Governance to manage entitlements and secure sign ins with Conditional Access policies. The policies use security attributes, like device health, session details, and risk to make adaptive access decisions. Microsoft Entra ID, Azure Resource Manager, and CI/CD pipelines authorize resource deployment in Azure.
