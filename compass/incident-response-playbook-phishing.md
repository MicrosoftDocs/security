# Phishing investigation

This article provides guidance on identifying and investigating phishing attacks within your organization. The step-by-step instructions will help you take the required remedial action to protect information and minimize further risks.

This article contains the following sections:

- **Prerequisites:** Covers the specific requirements you need to complete before starting the investigation. For example, logging that should be turned on, roles and permissions required, among others.
- **Workflow:** Shows the logical flow that you should follow to perform this investigation.
- **Checklist:** Contains a list of tasks for each of the steps in the flow chart. This checklist can be helpful in highly regulated environments to verify what you have done or simply as a quality gate for yourself.
- **Investigation steps:** Includes a detailed step-by-step guidance for this specific investigation.

## Prerequisites

Here are general settings and configurations you should complete before proceeding with the phishing investigation.

### Account details

Before proceeding with the investigation, it is recommended that you have the user name, user principal name (UPN) or the email address of the account that you suspect is compromised.

### Microsoft 365 base requirements

#### Verify auditing settings

Verify *mailbox auditing on by default* is turned on. To make sure that mailbox auditing is turned on for your organization, run the following command in Microsoft Exchange Online PowerShell:

```powershell
Get-OrganizationConfig | Format-List AuditDisabled
```

The value **False** indicates that mailbox auditing on by default is enabled for the organization. This *on by default* organizational value overrides the mailbox auditing setting on specific mailboxes. For example, if mailbox auditing is disabled for a mailbox (the *AuditEnabled* property is **False** on the mailbox), the default mailbox actions will still be audited for the mailbox, because mailbox auditing on by default is enabled for the organization.

>[!Note]
>If the tenant was created BEFORE 2019, then you should enable the *mailbox auditing* and *ALL auditing* settings. See how to [enable mailbox auditing](/office365/securitycompliance/enable-mailbox-auditing).
>

#### Verify mailbox auditing settings in the tenant

To verify all mailboxes in a given tenant, run the following command in the Exchange Online PowerShell:

```powershell
Get-Mailbox -ResultSize Unlimited -Filter {RecipientTypeDetails -eq "UserMailbox"} | Set-Mailbox -AuditEnabled $true
```

When a mailbox auditing is enabled, the default mailbox logging actions are applied:

- AuditLogAgeLimit: 90 days
- AuditAdmin:(Actions): *Update, Move, MoveToDeletedItems, SoftDelete, HardDelete*, *FolderBind, SendAs, SendonBehalf, Create*
- AuditDelegate:(Actions): *Update, SoftDelete, HardDelete, SendAs, Create*
- AuditOwner: (Actions) {}

To enable the setting for specific users, run the following command. In this example, the user is *johndoe@contoso.com*.

```powershell
Get-Mailbox -Identity "johndoe" | Set-Mailbox -AuditEnabled $true
```

### Message tracing

Message tracing logs are invaluable components to trace message of interest in order to understand the original source of the message as well as the intended recipients. You can use the *MessageTrace* functionality through the Microsoft [Exchange Online portal](/exchange/monitoring/trace-an-email-message/run-a-message-trace-and-view-results) or the [Get-MessageTrace PowerShell cmdlet](/powershell/module/exchange/mail-flow/get-messagetrace).

Several components of the *MessageTrace* functionality are self-explanatory but *Message-ID* is a unique identifier for an email message and requires thorough understanding. To obtain the *Message-ID* for an email of interest we need to examine the raw email headers.

### Microsoft 365 security and compliance center

To check whether a user viewed a specific document or purged an item in their mailbox, you can use the [Office 365 Security & Compliance Center](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-securitycompliance-center#:~:text=The%20Security%20%26%20Compliance%20Center%20is%20designed%20to,features%20bring%20together%20compliance%20capabilities%20across%20Office%20365.) and [check the permissions and roles of users and administrators](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/permissions-in-the-security-and-compliance-center).

You can also search the [unified audit log](/microsoft-365/compliance/search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance) and view all the activities of the user and administrator in your Office 365 organization.

### Are the sign-in logs and/or audit logs exported to an external system?

Since most of the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) sign-in and audit data will get overwritten after 30 or 90 days, Microsoft recommends that you leverage Sentinel, Azure Monitor or an external SIEM.

## Roles and permissions required

### Roles in Azure AD

We recommend the following roles are enabled for the account you will use to perform the investigation:

- [Global Reader ](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#global-reader)
- [Security Reader ](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#security-reader) 
- As a last resort, you can always fall back to the role of a [Global Administrator / Company Administrator](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#global-administrator--company-administrator)

### Roles in Microsoft 365 security and compliance center

Generally speaking, the [Global Reader](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#global-reader) or the [Security Reader](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/permissions-microsoft-365-compliance-security#security-reader) role should give you sufficient permissions to search the relevant logs.

>[!Note]
>If a user has the **View-Only Audit Logs** or **Audit Logs** role on the **Permissions** page in the Security & Compliance Center, they won't be able to search the Office 365 audit log. In this scenario, you must assign the permissions in Exchange Online because an [Exchange Online cmdlet](/microsoft-365/compliance/search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance) is used to search the log.
>

If you have implemented the role-based access control (RBAC) in Exchange or if you are unsure which role you need in Exchange, you can use PowerShell to get the roles required for an individual Exchange PowerShell cmdlet:

```powershell
$Perms | foreach {Get-ManagementRoleAssignment -Role $_.Name -Delegating $false | Format-Table -Auto Role,RoleAssigneeType,RoleAssigneeName}
```

For more information, see [permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](/powershell/exchange/exchange-server/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions). 

### Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

If you have Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) enabled and rolled out already, you should leverage it for this flow. See [Tackling phishing with signal-sharing and machine learning](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2018/12/19/tackling-phishing-with-signal-sharing-and-machine-learning/).

## System requirements

### Hardware requirements

The system should be able to run PowerShell.

### Software requirements

The following PowerShell modules are required for the investigation of the cloud environment:

- Azure AD
- Azure AD preview in some cases
- MS Online for Office 365
- Exchange connecting to Exchange for utilizing the unified audit log searches (inbox rules, message traces, forwarding rules, mailbox delegations, among others)
- Azure AD Incident Response

When you use Azure AD commands that are not part of the built-in modules in Azure, you need the MSOnline module - which is the same module that is used for Office 365. To work with Azure AD (which contains a set of functions) from PowerShell, install the Azure AD module.

## Installing various PowerShell modules

### Install the Azure AD PowerShell module

To install the Azure AD PowerShell module, follow these steps:

1. Run the **Windows PowerShell** app with elevated privileges (run as administrator).

2. To allow PowerShell to run signed scripts, run the following command:
    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
    ```

3. To install the Azure AD module, run the following command:

    ```powershell
    Install-Module -Name AzureAD -Verbose
    ```

    >[!Note]
    >If you are prompted to install modules from an untrusted repository, type **Y** and press **Enter**.
    >

### Install the MSOnline PowerShell module 

To install the MSOnline PowerShell module, follow these steps:

1. Run the **Windows PowerShell** app with elevated privileges (run as administrator).
2. To allow PowerShell to run signed scripts, run the following command:

    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
    ```

3. To install the MSOnline module, run the following command:

    ```powershell
    Install-Module -Name MSOnline -Verbose
    ```

    >[!Note]
    >If you are prompted to install modules from an untrusted repository, type **Y** and press **Enter**.
    >

### Install the Exchange PowerShell module

Please follow the steps on [how to get the Exchange PowerShell installed with multi-factor authentication (MFA)](/powershell/exchange/exchange-online/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell/mfa-connect-to-exchange-online-powershell). You must have access to a tenant, so you can download the Exchange Online PowerShell module from the **Hybrid** tab in the Exchange admin center (EAC).

 Once you have configured the required settings, you can proceed with the investigation.

### Install the Azure AD Incident Response module

The new [AzureADIncidentResponse](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AzureADIncidentResponse/4.0) PowerShell module provides rich filtering capabilities for Azure AD incidents. Use these steps to install it.

1. Run the **Windows PowerShell** app with elevated privileges (run as administrator).
2. Use this command.

    ```powershell
    Install-Module -Name AzureADIncidentResponse -RequiredVersion 4.0
    ```

    >[!Note]
    >If you are prompted to install modules from an untrusted repository, type **Y** and press **Enter**.
    >

## Checklist

This checklist will help you evaluate your investigation process and verify whether you have completed all the steps during investigation:

- Review initial phishing email
- Get the list of users who got this email
- Get the latest dates when the user had access to the mailbox
- Is delegated access configured on the mailbox?
- Is there a forwarding rule configured for the mailbox?
- Review your Mail Transport Rules

- Did the user read or open the email?
- Who else got the same email?
- Did the email contain an attachment?
- Was there payload in the attachment?
- Check email header for true source of the sender
- Verify IP addresses to attackers/campaigns
- Did the user click the link in the email?
- On what endpoint was the email opened?
- Was the attachment payload executed?
- Was the destination IP or URL touched or opened?
- Was malicious code executed?
- What sign-ins happened with the account for the federated scenario?
- What sign-ins happened with the account for the managed scenario?
- Investigate the source IP address
- Investigate the device ID found
- Investigate each App ID

You can also download the phishing and other incident playbook checklists as an [Excel file](https://download.microsoft.com/download/2/9/a/29a32dc4-d126-42af-a825-ffb944135a50/Incident-Response-Playbook-Checklists.xlsx).

## Investigation steps

For this investigation, it is assumed that you either have a sample phishing email, or parts of it like the sender’s address, subject of the email, or parts of the message to start the investigation. Please also make sure that you have completed / enabled all settings as recommended in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

This playbook is created with the intention that not all Microsoft customers and their investigation teams will have the full Microsoft 365 E5 or Azure AD Premium P2 license suite available or configured in the tenant that is being investigated. We will however highlight additional automation capabilities when appropriate.

### [Get the list of users / identities who got the email](#findemail)

As the very first step, you need to get a list of users / identities who received the phishing email. The objective of this step is to record a list of potential users / identities that you will later use to iterate through for additional investigation steps. Please refer to the [Workflow](#workflow) section for a high-level flow diagram of the steps you need to follow during this investigation.

We do not give any recommendations in this playbook on how you want to record this list of potential users / identities. Depending on the size of the investigation, you can leverage an Excel book, a CSV file, or even a database for larger investigations. There are multiple ways to obtain the list of identities in a given tenant, and here are some examples.

### Create a search filter within the security & compliance center

Navigate to the security & compliance center in Microsoft 365 and create a new search filter, using the indicators you have been provided. Follow the guidance on [how to create a search filter](/microsoft-365/compliance/content-search#create-a-search).

For a full list of searchable patterns in the security & compliance center, refer to the article on [searchable email properties](/microsoft-365/compliance/keyword-queries-and-search-conditions#searchable-email-properties).

#### Sample search patterns

The following example query returns messages that were received by users between April 13, 2016 and April 14, 2016 and that contain the words "action" and "required" in the subject line:

```SearchFilter
(Received:4/13/2016..4/14/2016) AND (Subject:'Action required')
```

The following example query returns messages that were sent by *chatsuwloginsset12345@outlook\[.\]com* and that contain the exact phrase "*Update your account information*" in the subject line.

```SearchFilter
(From:chatsuwloginsset12345@outlook.com) AND (Subject:"Update your account information")
```

For more details, see how to [search for and delete messages in your organization](/microsoft-365/compliance/search-for-and-delete-messages-in-your-organization).

###  Use the Search-Mailbox cmdlet

You can use the `Search-mailbox` cmdlet to perform a specific search query against a target mailbox of interest and copy the results to an unrelated destination mailbox.  

The following example query searches Jane Smith mailbox for an email that contains the phrase Invoice in the subject and copies the results to IRMailbox in a folder named "Investigation."

```powershell
Search-Mailbox -Identity "Jane Smith" -SearchQuery "Subject:Invoice" -TargetMailbox "IRMailbox" -TargetFolder "Investigation" LogLevel Full
```

In this example command, the query searches all tenant mailboxes for an email that contains the phrase "InvoiceUrgent" in the subject and copies the results to IRMailbox in a folder named "Investigation."

```powershell
Get-Mailbox | Search-Mailbox -SearchQuery 'InvoiceUrgent vote' -TargetMailbox "IRMailbox" -TargetFolder "Investigation" -LogLevel Full
```

### Is delegated access configured on the mailbox?

See how to check whether [delegated access is configured on the mailbox](https://github.com/OfficeDev/O365-InvestigationTooling/blob/master/DumpDelegatesandForwardingRules.ps1).

To create this report, run a small PowerShell script that gets a list of all your users. Then, use the Get-MailboxPermission cmdlet to create a CSV file of all the mailbox delegates in your tenancy.

Look for unusual names or permission grants. If you see something unusual, contact the mailbox owner to check whether it is legitimate.

### Are there forwarding rule(s) configured for the mailbox?

In this step, you need to check each mailbox that was previously identified for forwarding rules or inbox rules. For forwarding rules, use the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
Get-Mailbox | select UserPrincipalName,ForwardingSmtpAddress,DeliverToMailboxAndForward | Export-csv c:\temp\Forwarding.csv -NoTypeInformation
```

Here's an example query:

```powershell
Search-UnifiedAuditLog -startdate 12/16/2019 -EndDate 03/16/2019 -ResultSize 5000 -recordtype exchangeadmin -Operations New-InboxRule |Export-csv NoTypeInformation -Path c:\temp\Inboxrulesoutput.csv
```

Additionally, you can also utilize the *Inbox and Forwarding Rules* report in the Office 365 security & compliance center.

1. Navigate to [Dashboard &gt; Report Viewer - Security & Compliance](https://protection.office.com/reportv2?id=MailFlowForwarding&pivot=Name).

2. Look for unusual target locations, or any kind of external addressing.

3. Also look for forwarding rules with unusual key words in the criteria such as *all mail with the word invoice in the subject*. Contact the mailbox owner to check whether it is legitimate.

### Review inbox rules

Additionally, check for the removal of Inbox rules. As an example, use the following PowerShell commmand:

```powershell
Search-UnifiedAuditLog -startDate 12/16/2019 -EndDate 03/16/2020 -Operations Remove-InboxRule |Export-CSV NoTypeInformation -Path c:\temp\removedInboxRules.csv
```

Look for inbox rules that were removed, consider the timestamps in proximity to your investigations.

### Review mail transport rules

There are two ways to obtain the list of transport rules.

1. In the Exchange admin center, navigate to **Mail &gt; Flow &gt; Rules**.
2.  In the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center, navigate to [Dashboard Report Viewer &gt; Security & Compliance - Exchange Transport Rule report](https://protection.office.com/reportv2?id=ETRRuleReport&pivot=Direction) and create a report.

The summary view of the report shows you a list of all the mail transport rules you have configured for your tenancy. When you select any given rule, you'll see details of the rule in a **Summary** pane to the right, which includes the qualifying criteria and action taken when the rule condition matches.

Look for new rules, or rules that have been modified to redirect the mail to external domains. The number of rules should be relatively small such that you can maintain a list of known good rules. If you a create a new rule, then you should make a new entry in the Audit report for that event. You can search the report to determine who created the rule and from where they created it. If you see something unusual, contact the creator to determine if it is legitimate.

### Get the latest dates when the user had access to the mailbox

In the Office 365 security & compliance center, navigate to [unified audit log](https://protection.office.com/#/unifiedauditlog). Under **Activities** in the drop-down list, you can filter by **Exchange Mailbox Activities**.

The capability to list compromised users is available in the [Microsoft 365 security & compliance center](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/view-email-security-reports#compromised-users-report-new). 

This report shows activities that could indicate a mailbox is being accessed illicitly. It includes created or received messages, moved or deleted messages, copied or purged messages, sent messages using send on behalf or send as, and all mailbox sign ins. The data includes date, IP address, user, activity performed, the item affected, and any extended details.

>[!Note]
>For this data to be recorded, you must enable the **mailbox auditing** option.
>


The volume of data included here could be very substantial, so focus your search on users that would have high-impact if breached. Look for unusual patterns such as odd times of the day, or unusual IP addresses, and look for patterns such as high volumes of moves, purges, or deletes.

### Did the user read / open the email?

There are two main cases here:

- Microsoft Exchange Online
- Hybrid Exchange with on-premises Exchange servers.

#### Microsoft Exchange Online

Use the `Search-Mailbox` cmdlet to perform a specific search query against a target mailbox of interest and copy the results to an unrelated destination mailbox.  
The following example query searches Janes Smith’s mailbox for an email that contains the phrase *Invoice* in the subject and copies the results to *IRMailbox* in a folder named *Investigation.*

```powershell
Search-Mailbox -Identity "Jane Smith" -SearchQuery "Subject:Invoice" -TargetMailbox "IRMailbox" -TargetFolder "Investigation" LogLevel Full
```

The following sample query searches all tenant mailboxes for an email that contains the phrase *InvoiceUrgent* in the subject and copies the results to I*RMailbox* in a folder named *Investigation*.

```powershell
Get-Mailbox | Search-Mailbox -SearchQuery 'InvoiceUrgent vote' -TargetMailbox "IRMailbox" -TargetFolder "Investigation" -LogLevel Full
```

#### Exchange on-premises

Use the `Get-MessageTrackingLog` cmdlet to search for message delivery information stored in the message tracking log. Here's an example:

```powershell
Get-MessageTrackingLog -Server Mailbox01 -Start "03/13/2018 09:00:00" -End "03/15/2018 17:00:00" -Sender "john@contoso.com"
```

For information about parameter sets, see the [Exchange cmdlet syntax](/powershell/exchange/exchange-server/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

### Who else got the same email?

There are two main cases here: You have Exchange Online or Hybrid Exchange with on-premises Exchange servers. The workflow is essentially the same as explained in the topic <a name ="findemail">Get the list of users/identities who got the email.</a> 

#### Exchange Online

Use the `Search-Mailbox` cmdlet to perform a specific search query against a target mailbox of interest and copy the results to an unrelated destination mailbox.

This sample query searches all tenant mailboxes for an email that contains the subject *InvoiceUrgent* in the subject and copies the results to *IRMailbox* in a folder named *Investigation*.

```powershell
Get-Mailbox | Search-Mailbox -SearchQuery "Subject:InvoiceUrgent" -TargetMailbox "IRMailbox" -TargetFolder "Investigation" -LogLevel Full
```

#### Exchange on-premises

Use the `Get-MessageTrackingLog` cmdlet to search for message delivery information stored in the message tracking log. Here's an example:

```powershell
Get-MessageTrackingLog -Server Mailbox01 -Start "03/13/2018 09:00:00" -End "03/15/2018 17:00:00" -MessageSubject "InvoiceUrgent"
```

### Did the email contain an attachment?

You have two options for Exchange Online:

1. Use the classic `Search-Mailbox` cmdlet
2. Use the `New-ComplianceSearch` cmdlet

#### Exchange Online

Use the `Search-Mailbox` cmdlet to perform a specific search query against a target mailbox of interest and copy the results to an unrelated destination mailbox. Here's an example:

```powershell
Get-Mailbox -ResultSize unlimited | Search-Mailbox -SearchQuery attachment:trojan* -TargetMailbox "IRMailbox" -TargetFolder "Investigation" -LogLevel Full
```

The other option is to use the `New-ComplianceSearch` cmdlet. Here's an example:

```powershell
New-ComplianceSearch -Name "Investigation" -ExchangeLocation "Research Department" -ContentMatchQuery "from:pilar@contoso.com AND hasattachment:true"
```

#### Exchange on-premises

Use the `Search-Mailbox` cmdlet to search for message delivery information stored in the message tracking log. Here's an example:

```powershell
Search-Mailbox -Identity "Jane Smith"-SearchQuery AttachmentNames:attachment_name -TargetMailbox "IRMailbox" -TargetFolder "Investigation" -LogLevel Full
```

>[!Note]
>For Exchange 2013, you need CU12 to have this [cmdlet](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/search-mailbox-cmdlet-with-attachment-keyword-lists-all-items-that-contain-the-query-string-of-attachment-b0422602-9f14-e85a-434f-81a14549574d) running.
>

### Was there payload in the attachment?

In this step, look for potential malicious content in the attachment, for example, PDF files, obfuscated PowerShell, or other script codes.

The **Malware Detections** report shows the number of incoming and outgoing messages that were detected as containing malware for your organization.

To view this report, in the security & compliance center, go to [Reports >  Dashboard > Malware Detections](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/view-email-security-reports#malware-detections-report).  

Similar to the **Threat Protection Status** report, this report also displays data for the past seven days by default. However, you can choose filters to change the date range for up to 90 days to view the details. (If you are using a trial subscription, you might be limited to 30 days of data.) To see the details, select **View details table** or export the report.

### Check email header for true source of the sender

Many of the components of the message trace functionality are self-explanatory but you need to thoroughly understand about *Message-ID*. The *Message-ID* is a unique identifier for an email message. 

To obtain the *Message-ID* for an email of interest, you need to examine the raw email headers. Examination of the email headers will vary according to the email client being used. However, typically within Office 365, open the email message and from the **Reading** pane, select **View Original Message** to identify the email client. If in doubt, a simple search on how to view the message headers in the respective email client should provide further guidance.

You should start by looking at the email headers. For example, in Outlook 365, open the message, navigate to **File > Info > Properties**:

:::image type="content" source="./media/incident-response-playbook-phishing/checkemail.png" alt-text="Example of a properties screen showing email headers":::
*Properties screen showing email headers*

When viewing an email header, it is recommended to copy and paste the header information into an email header analyzer provided by [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx) or [Azure](https://mha.azurewebsites.net/) for readability.

- **Headers Routing Information:** The routing information provides the route of an email as its being transferred between computers.
- **Sender Policy Framework (SPF):** An email validation to help prevent/detect spoofing. In the SPF record, you can determine which IP addresses and domains can send emails on behalf of the domain.
- **SPF = Pass:** The SPF TXT record determined the sender is permitted to send on behalf of a domain.
    - SPF = Neutral
    - SPF = Fail: The policy configuration determines the outcome of the message  
        Sender IP
    - SMTP Mail: Validate if this is a legitimate domain

- **Common Values:** Here is a breakdown of the most commonly used and viewed headers, and their values. This is valuable information and you can use them in the **Search** fields in Threat Explorer.
    - From address
    - Subject
    - Message ID
    - To address
    - Return-path address

- **Authentication-Results:** You can find what your email client authenticated when the email was sent. It will provide you with SPF and DKIM authentication.

- **Originating IP:** The original IP can be used to determine if the IP is blocklisted and to obtain the geo location.

- **Spam Confidence Level (SCL):** This determines the probability of an incoming email is spam.  
    **SCL Rating:**
    - -1: Non-spam coming from a safe sender, safe recipient, or safe listed IP address (trusted partner)
    - 0, 1: Non-spam because the message was scanned and determined to be clean 
    - 5, 6: Spam
    - 7, 8, 9: High confidence spam

The SPF record is stored within a DNS database and is bundled with the DNS lookup information. You can manually check the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) record for a domain by using the *nslookup* command:

1. Open the command prompt (**Start > Run > cmd**).
2. Type the command as: *nslookup -type=txt"* a space, and then the domain/host name. For example:

    ```powershell
     nslookup -type=txt domainname.com
    ```

>[!Note]
>*-all* (reject or fail them - don't deliver the email if anything does not match), this is recommended.
>

### Check if DKIM is enabled on your custom domains in Office 365

You need to publish two CNAME records for every domain they want to add the domain keys identified mail (DKIM). See how to [use DKIM to validate outbound email sent from your custom domain](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/use-dkim-to-validate-outbound-email).

### Check for domain-based message authentication, reporting, and conformance (DMARC)

You can use this feature to [validate outbound emails in Office 365](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/use-dmarc-to-validate-email#CreateDMARCRecord).

### Verify IP addresses to attackers/campaigns

To verify or investigate IP addresses that have been identified from the previous investigation steps, you can use any of these options:

- VirusTotal
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Public Sources:
    - [Ipinfo.io](http://ipinfo.io/) - Has a free option to obtain geo-location
    - [Censys.io](http://censys.io/) - Has a free option to obtain information about what their passive scans of the internet know
    - [AbuseIPDB.com](https://www.abuseipdb.com/)  - Has a free option that provides some geolocation
    - Ask Bing and Google - Search on the IP address

### URL reputation

You can use any Windows 10 device and Microsoft Edge browser which leverages the [SmartScreen](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-smartscreen/microsoft-defender-smartscreen-overview) technology.

Here are a few third-party URL reputation examples

- [Trend Micro Site Safety Check](https://global.sitesafety.trendmicro.com/)
- [Google Transparency Report](https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/search?hl=en) 
- [Talos Intelligency](https://talosintelligence.com/reputation_center/)

As you investigate the IP addresses and URLs, look for and correlate IP addresses to indicators of compromise (IOCs) or other indicators, depending on the output or results and add them to a list of sources from the adversary.

### [Did the user click the link in the email?](#clicklink)

If the user has clicked the link in the email (on-purpose or not), then this action typically leads to a new process creation on the device itself. Depending on the device this was performed, you need perform device-specific investigations. For example, Windows vs Android vs iOS. In this article, we have described a general approach along with some details for Windows-based devices. If you are using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE), then you can also leverage it for iOS and soon Android.

You can investigate these events using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

1. **VPN/proxy logs**  
    Depending on the vendor of the proxy and VPN solutions, you need to check the relevant logs. Ideally you are forwarding the events to your SIEM or to Microsoft Sentinel.

2. **Using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**  
    This is the best-case scenario, because you can use our threat intelligence and automated analysis to help your investigation. For more details, see [how to investigate alerts in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/investigate-alerts). 

    The **Alert process tree** takes alert triage and investigation to the next level, displaying the aggregated alerts and surrounding evidences that occurred within the same execution context and time period.  
    ![Example of the alert process tree](./media/incident-response-playbook-phishing/alertprocesstree.png)
     
3.  **Windows-based client devices**  
    Make sure you have enabled the [**Process Creation Events**](/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4688) option. Ideally, you should also enable [command-line Tracing Events](/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/component-updates/command-line-process-auditing).

    On Windows clients, which have the above-mentioned Audit Events enabled prior to the investigation, you can check Audit Event 4688 and determine the time when the email was delivered to the user:

### On what endpoint was the email opened?

The tasks here are similar to the previous investigation step: <a name="clicklink"> Did the user click the link in the email?</a>

### Was the attached payload executed?

The tasks here are similar to the previous investigation step: <a name="clicklink"> Did the user click the link in the email?</a>

### Was the destination IP / URL touched or opened?

The tasks here are similar to the previous investigation step: <a name="clicklink"> Did the user click the link in the email?</a>

### Was malicious code executed?

The tasks here are similar to the previous investigation step: <a name="clicklink"> Did the user click the link in the email?</a>

### What sign-ins happened with the account?

Check the various sign-ins that happened with the account.

### Federated scenario

The audit log settings and events differ based on the operating system (OS) Level and the Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) Server version.

See the following sections for different server versions.

#### Server 2012R2

By default, security events are not audited on Server 2012R2. You need to enable this feature on each ADFS Server in the Farm. In the ADFS Management console and select **Edit Federation Service Properties**. 

![federatedproperties](./media/incident-response-playbook-phishing/Federatedservices.png)

You also need to enable the **OS Auditing Policy**.

Open the command prompt, and run the following command as an administrator.

```powershell
auditpol.exe /set /subcategory:”Application Generated” /failure:enable /success:enable
```

For more details, see [how to configure ADFS servers for troubleshooting](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc738766(v=ws.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN#BKMK_97).

You may want to also download the ADFS PowerShell modules from:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/adfsToolbox/tree/master/eventsModule)
- [Microsoft scriptcenter](https://github.com/Microsoft/adfsToolbox/tree/master/eventsModule)

#### Server 2016 and newer

By default, ADFS in Windows Server 2016 has basic auditing enabled. With basic auditing, administrators can see five or less events for a single request. But you can raise or lower the auditing level by using this command:

```powershell
Set-AdfsProperties -AuditLevel Verbose
```
For more details, see [auditing enhancements to ADFS in Windows server](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/technical-reference/auditing-enhancements-to-ad-fs-in-windows-server).

If you have Azure AD Connect Health installed, you should also look into the Risky IP report. The failed sign-in activity client IP addresses are aggregated through Web Application proxy servers. Each item in the Risky IP report shows aggregated information about failed AD FS sign-in activities that exceed the designated threshold.

:::image type="content" source="./media/incident-response-playbook-phishing/timestamp.png" alt-text="Example of the risky IP report":::

For more details, see [Risky IP report](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-health-adfs-risky-ip).

#### Server 2012R2

**Event ID 342** – "The user name or password are incorrect" in the ADFS admin logs.

For the actual audit events, you need to look at the Security events logs and you should look for events with Event ID 411 for *Classic Audit Failure* with the source as *ADFS Auditing*. Also look for Event ID 412 on successful authentication.

**Event ID 411** - *SecurityTokenValidationFailureAudit Token* validation failed. See inner exception for more details.

![Example of an event 411](./media/incident-response-playbook-phishing/tokenvalidation.png)

![Example of an event 412](./media/incident-response-playbook-phishing/Event412.png)

You may need to correlate the Event with the corresponding Event ID 501.

#### Server 2016 and newer

For the actual audit events you need to look at the security events logs and you should look for events with look for Event ID 1202 for successful authentication events and 1203 for failures

Example for Event ID1202:

*Event ID 1202 FreshCredentialSuccessAudit The Federation Service validated a new credential. See XML for details.*

Example for Event ID 1203:

*Event ID 1203 FreshCredentialFailureAudit The Federation Service failed to validate a new credential. See XML for failure details.*

![Example of an event 1203](./media/incident-response-playbook-phishing/event1203.png)

![Example of an event 4624](./media/incident-response-playbook-phishing/Event4624.png)

To get the full list of ADFS Event ID per OS Level, refer to [GetADFSEventList](https://adfshelp.microsoft.com/AdfsEventViewer/GetAdfsEventList).

### Managed scenario

Check the Azure AD sign-in logs for the user(s) you are investigating.

- Navigate to the [Azure AD portal > Sign-in](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/SignIns) screen
- Check the [sign-in activities](/graph/api/resources/signinactivity)
- Check the [PowerShell function on GitHub](https://github.com/poshchap/Azure-AD-Users-PoSh/blob/master/Get-AzureADUserLastSignInActivity.ps1)

In the Azure AD portal, navigate to the [Sign-ins](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/SignIns) screen and add/modify the display filter for the timeframe you found in the previous investigation steps as well as add the user name as a filter, as shown in this image.

:::image type="content" source="./media/incident-response-playbook-phishing/DisplayFilter.png" alt-text="Example of a display filter":::

You can also search using Graph API. For example, filter on **User properties** and get **lastSignInDate** along with it. Search for a specific user to get the last signed in date for this user.
For example, `https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/users?$filter=startswith(displayName,'Dhanyah')&$select=displayName,signInActivity`

Or you can use the PowerShell command `Get-AzureADUserLastSignInActivity` to get the last interactive sign-in activity for the user, targeted by their object ID. This example writes the output to a date and time stamped CSV file in the execution directory.

```powershell
Get-AzureADUserLastSignInActivity -TenantId 536279f6-1234-2567-be2d-61e352b51eef -UserObjectId 69447235-0974-4af6-bfa3-d0e922a92048 -CsvOutput
```

Or you can use this command from the AzureADIncidentResponse PowerShell module:

```powershell
Get-AzureADIRSignInDetail -UserId johcast@Contoso.com -TenantId 536279f6-1234-2567-be2d-61e352b51eef -RangeFromDaysAgo 29 -RangeToDaysAgo 3
```

### Investigate source IP address

Based on the source IP addresses that you found in the Azure AD sign-in logs or the ADFS/Federation Server log files, investigate further to know from where the traffic originated.

### Managed user

For a managed scenario, you should start looking at the sign-in logs and filter based on the source IP address:

:::image type="content" source="./media/incident-response-playbook-phishing/managedusersip.png" alt-text="Example of a managed user IP address]":::

Or you can use this command from the AzureADIncidentResponse PowerShell module:

```powershell
Get-AzureADIRSignInDetail -IpAddress 1.2.3.4 -TenantId 536279f6-1234-2567-be2d-61e352b51eef -RangeFromDaysAgo 29 -RangeToDaysAgo 3 -OutGridView
```

When you look into the results list, navigate to the **Device info** tab. Depending on the device used, you will get varying output. Here are a few examples:

- Example 1 - Un-managed device (BYOD):

  :::image type="content" source="./media/incident-response-playbook-phishing/unmanageddevice.png" alt-text="Example of a unmanaged device":::

- Example 2 - Managed device (Azure AD join or hybrid Azure AD join):

  :::image type="content" source="./media/incident-response-playbook-phishing/Manageddevice.png" alt-text="Example of a managed device":::

Check for the DeviceID if one is present. You should also look for the OS and the browser or *UserAgent* string.

:::image type="content" source="./media/incident-response-playbook-phishing/DeviceID.png" alt-text="Example of a device ID":::

Record the *CorrelationID*, *Request ID* and *timestamp*. You should use *CorrelationID* and *timestamp* to correlate your findings to other events.

### Federated user/application

Follow the same procedure that is provided for [Federated sign-in scenario](#federated-scenario).

Look for and record the *DeviceID, OS Level, CorrelationID, RequestID.*

### Investigate the identified DeviceID

This step is relevant for only those devices that are known to Azure AD. For example, from the previous steps, if you found one or more potential device IDs, then you can investigate further on this device. Look for and record the *DeviceID* and *Device Owner*.

### Investigate each AppID

The starting point here are the sign-in logs and the app configuration of the tenant or the federation servers' configuration.

#### Managed scenario

From the previously found sign-in log details, check the *Application ID* under the **Basic info** tab:

:::image type="content" source="./media/incident-response-playbook-phishing/managedscenario1.png" alt-text="managedscenario":::

Note the differences between the Application (and ID) to the Resource (and ID). The application is the client component involved, whereas the Resource is the service / application in Azure AD.

With this AppID, you can now perform research in the tenant. Here's an example:

```powershell
Get-AzureADApplication -Filter "AppId eq '30d4cbf1-c561-454e-bf01-528cd5eafd58'"

ObjectId                              |   AppId                                |    DisplayName

3af6dc4e-b0e5-45ec-8272-56f3f3f875ad     30d4cbf1-c561-454e-bf01-528cd5eafd58         Claims X-Ray
```

With this information, you can search in the Enterprise Applications portal. Navigate to **All Applications** and search for the specific AppID.
