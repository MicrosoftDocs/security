# DoD Zero Trust Strategy for the automation and orchestration pillar

The [DoD Zero Trust Strategy and Roadmap](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3225919/department-of-defense-releases-zero-trust-strategy-and-roadmap/) outlines a path for Department of Defense components and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) partners to adopt a new cybersecurity framework based on Zero Trust principles. Zero Trust eliminates traditional perimeters and trust assumptions, enabling a more efficient architecture that enhances security, user experiences, and mission performance. 

This guide has recommendations for the 152 Zero Trust activities in the [DoD Zero Trust Capability Execution Roadmap](https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/Library/ZTCapabilitiesActivities.pdf). The sections correspond with the seven pillars of the DoD Zero Trust model.

## 6 Automation and orchestration

This section has Microsoft guidance and recommendations for DoD Zero Trust activities in the automation and orchestration pillar. To learn more, see [visibility, automation, and orchestration with Zero Trust](/security/zero-trust/deploy/visibility-automation-orchestration).

## 6.1 Policy decision point (PDP) and policy orchestration

Microsoft Sentinel has security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) through cloud-based resources. Automate detection and responses to cyber-attacks. Sentinel integrates with Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft Defender XDR, Microsoft 365, Azure, and non-Microsoft platforms. These extensible integrations enable Sentinel to coordinate cybersecurity detection and response actions across platforms, increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of security operations.
