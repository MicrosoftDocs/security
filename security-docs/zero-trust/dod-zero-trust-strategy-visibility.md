# DoD Zero Trust Strategy for the visibility and analytics pillar

The [DoD Zero Trust Strategy and Roadmap](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3225919/department-of-defense-releases-zero-trust-strategy-and-roadmap/) outlines a path for Department of Defense components and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) partners to adopt a new cybersecurity framework based on Zero Trust principles. Zero Trust eliminates traditional perimeters and trust assumptions, enabling a more efficient architecture that enhances security, user experiences, and mission performance. 

This guide has recommendations for the 152 Zero Trust activities in the [DoD Zero Trust Capability Execution Roadmap](https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/Library/ZTCapabilitiesActivities.pdf). The sections correspond with the seven pillars of the DoD Zero Trust model.

## 7 Visibility and analytics

This section has Microsoft guidance and recommendations for DoD Zero Trust activities in the visibility and analytics pillar. To learn more, see [Visibility, automation, and orchestration with Zero Trust](/security/zero-trust/deploy/visibility-automation-orchestration).

## 7.1 Log all traffic

Microsoft Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native security information event management (SIEM) system. Also, Sentinel is a security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) solution to handle large data volumes from various sources. Sentinel data connectors ingest data across users, devices, applications, and infrastructure, on-premises and in multiple clouds.
