# Accelerate vulnerability mitigation (Secure Future Initiative)

**Pillar name: Accelerate response ​and remediation**<br>
**Pattern name: Accelerate vulnerability mitigation**

## Context and problem

Vulnerabilities are an unavoidable reality in complex digital environments. Organizations must respond quickly and systematically to reduce risk, yet many struggle with slow coordination, manual triage, and inconsistent remediation workflows.

Traditional patching models and legacy reporting structures often delay responses, especially when security and IT teams operate in silos. Meanwhile, threat actors capitalize on unpatched systems and misconfigurations to escalate privileges, move laterally, or exfiltrate data.

## Solution

To address these challenges, Microsoft has implemented a comprehensive vulnerability management program focused on automation and faster disclosure. These efforts were carried out as part of the accelerate response and remediation pillar of the Secure Future Initiative (SFI). Overall, this program supports early detection, consistent prioritization, and accelerated time to mitigate (TTM), and is especially effective for high-severity issues.  In fact, it enabled Microsoft to reduce TTM for 73% of vulnerabilities while expanding the scope of the program.

**Key components of Microsoft’s approach include:**

- Automating vulnerability detection and triage using Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management and internal AI tools

- Creating machine-readable vulnerability disclosures via Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) files

- Publishing CVE publishing for cloud service vulnerabilities more quickly, including cases where no customer patch is required

- Delivering targeted alerting via Azure Service Health and Microsoft 365 admin center, with actionable guidance delivered at the tenant or subscription level

- Centralizing  incident handling, customer engagement, and disclosure through cross-company workflows.

- Issuing nation-state threat notifications (NSNs) to alert affected organizations of targeted or successful attacks

## Guidance

Organizations can adopt a similar pattern using the following actionable practices:

|Use case|Recommended action |Resource |
|---|---|---|
| Establish a robust vulnerability management program   | <ul><li>Appoint owners responsible for detection, prioritization, and remediation</li><li>Ensure consistent asset visibility and configuration baselines</li><li>Align security and IT workflows from discovery through resolution</li></ul>|[Incident readiness guide](/services-hub/unified/health/incident-readiness/) |
| Automate detection and triage |<ul><li>Use tools like Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management to scan systems and prioritize CVEs</li><li>Integrate with threat intelligence feeds to flag actively exploited vulnerabilities</li><li>Use risk-based scoring to focus on the vulnerabilities that matter most</li></ul>| [Microsoft Defender vulnerability management](/defender-vulnerability-management/)  |
| Standardize and accelerate communication |<ul><li>Publish CVEs even when customer action is not required, as transparency builds trust </li> <li>Use CSAF files and Microsoft’s Security Updates API to enable machine-to-machine consumption</li><li>Build alerting workflows in Azure Service Health and Microsoft 365 admin center to reach incident responders</li></ul>| [Microsoft Security response center](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/)  |
| Create visibility and accountability |<ul><li>Monitor and report on time to mitigate (TTM), aging vulnerabilities, and patch coverage</li><li>Design dashboards to track progress and flag delays </li><li>Implement internal escalation paths for high-priority vulnerabilities</li></ul>| [Manage incidents in Microsoft Defender](/defender-xdr/manage-incidents/)   |
| Prepare for nation-state activity |<ul><li>Understand Microsoft’s NSN program and be ready to respond if notified </li><li>Configure alert routing so that SOC and security teams receive threat intelligence immediately</li><li>Regularly review NSN guidance in Microsoft portals and Digital Defense Reports</li></ul>|  [Nation State threats report](https://www.microsoft.com/security/security-insider/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2023-nation-state-threats)  |
| Continuously improve   |<ul><li>Use red teaming reports, post-incident reviews, and customer feedback to refine response processes </li><li>Look for opportunities to automate workflows, reduce handoffs, and improve notification targeting</li></ul>| [Investigate and respond using Microsoft Defender XDR](/defender-xdr/pilot-deploy-investigate-respond/)  |

## Outcomes

### Benefits

- Greater awareness of cloud vulnerabilities through expanded CVE publications and advisories regarding whether a customer fix is required

- Increased transparency and trust via enriched CVE data (CWE/CPE tagging) and automated alert delivery, along with expanded vulnerability disclosure

- Faster and more actionable communications via customer-facing product portals

- Faster mitigation timelines through automation and AI that streamline the vulnerability-to-patch lifecycle

- Proactive defense that uses enhanced threat intelligence to support earlier detection and prioritized response

### Trade-offs

- Prioritizing vulnerability response based on potential impact, threat activity, and required customer action

- Scoping investments in automated scanning, classification, and workflow orchestration to address the most serious vulnerabilities as the highest priority

- Keeping human and organizational factors in focus while redesigning processes that unify security, IT, and communications teams

## Key success factors

Track the following KPIs to measure progress:

- Average time to mitigate (TTM) high-severity vulnerabilities

- Percentage of CVEs addressed within SLA

- Alert configuration status across cloud subscriptions

## Summary

Organizations can dramatically improve how quickly they respond to known vulnerabilities. With automation, enriched communications, and integrated vulnerability workflows, teams can limit exposure, close known gaps faster, and build the resilience required to stay ahead of active threats.

**Begin accelerating your vulnerability response today—before attackers exploit the delay.**
