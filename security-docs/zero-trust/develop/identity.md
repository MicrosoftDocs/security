# Building apps that secure identity through permissions and consent

This article continues from the [Zero Trust identity and access management development best practices](identity-iam-development-best-practices.md) article to help you use a Zero Trust approach to identity in your software development lifecycle (SDLC).

Here's an overview of the **Permissions and access** articles in this [Developer Guide](overview.md) so that you can dive into identity components that include authentication, authorization, and identity management.

- [Integrating applications with Microsoft Entra ID and the Microsoft identity platform](integrate-apps-microsoft-identity-platform.md) helps developers to build and integrate apps that IT pros can secure in the enterprise by securely integrate apps with Microsoft Entra ID and the Microsoft identity platform.
- [Registering applications](app-registration.md) introduces developers to the application registration process and its requirements. It helps them to ensure that apps satisfy Zero Trust principles of use least privileged access and assume breach.
- [Supported identity and account types for single- and multi-tenant apps](identity-supported-account-types.md) explains how you can choose if your app allows only users from your Microsoft Entra tenant, any Microsoft Entra tenant, or users with personal Microsoft accounts.
- [Authenticating users for Zero Trust](user-authentication.md) helps developers to learn best practices for authenticating application users in Zero Trust application development. It describes how to enhance application security with the Zero Trust principles of least privilege and verify explicitly.
- [Acquiring authorization to access resources](acquire-application-authorization-to-access-resources.md) helps you to understand how to best ensure Zero Trust when acquiring resource access permissions for your application.
- [Developing delegated permissions strategy](developer-strategy-delegated-permission.md) helps you to implement the best approach for managing permissions in your application and develop using Zero Trust principles.
- [Developing application permissions strategy](developer-strategy-application-permissions.md) helps you to decide upon your application permissions approach to credential management.
- [Requesting permissions that require administrative consent](permissions-require-admin-consent.md) describes the permission and consent experience when application permissions require administrative consent.
- [Reducing overprivileged permissions and apps](overprivileged-permissions.md) helps you to understand why applications shouldn't request more permissions than they need (overprivileged). Learn how to limit privilege to manage access and improve security.
- [Providing application identity credentials when there's no user](identity-non-user-applications.md) explains why the best Zero Trust client credentials practice for services (non-user applications) on Azure is Managed Identities for Azure resources.
- [Managing tokens for Zero Trust](token-management.md) helps developers to build security into applications with ID tokens, access tokens, and security tokens that your they can receive from the Microsoft identity platform.
- [Customizing tokens](zero-trust-token-customization.md) describes the information that you can receive in Microsoft Entra tokens and how you can customize tokens.
- [Securing applications with Continuous Access Evaluation](secure-with-cae.md) helps developers to improve application security with Continuous Access Evaluation. Learn how to [ensure Zero Trust support](overview.md) in your apps that receive authorization to access resources when they acquire access tokens from Microsoft Entra ID.
- [Configuring group claims and app roles in tokens](configure-tokens-group-claims-app-roles.md) shows you how to configure your apps with app role definitions and assign security groups.
- [API Protection](protect-api.md) describes best practices for protecting your API through registration, defining permissions and consent, and enforcing access to achieve your Zero Trust goals.
- [Example of API protected by Microsoft identity consent framework](protected-api-example.md) helps you to design least privilege application permissions strategies for the best user experience.
- [Calling an API from another API](api-calls-api.md) helps you to ensure Zero Trust when you have one API that needs to call another API. Learn how to securely develop your application when it's working on behalf of a user.
- [Authorization best practices](developer-strategy-authorization-best-practices.md) helps you to implement the best authorization, permission, and consent models for your applications.
