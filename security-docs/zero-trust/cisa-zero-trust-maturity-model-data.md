# CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model for the data pillar

This section has Microsoft guidance and recommendations for the [CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model](https://www.cisa.gov/zero-trust-maturity-model) in the data pillar. See [Secure data with Zero Trust](/security/zero-trust/deploy/data) for more information. The CISA definition of data includes all structured and unstructured files and fragments that reside, or resided in, federal systems, devices, networks, applications, databases, infrastructure, and backups (including on-premises and virtual environments), also the associated metadata.  

## 5 Data

Protect enterprise data on devices, in applications, and on networks in accordance with federal requirements. Maintain an inventory of, categorize, and label data. Protect data at rest, in transit, and in use. Deploy mechanisms to detect and stop data exfiltration. Craft and review data governance policies to ensure data lifecycles are enforced across the enterprise.
