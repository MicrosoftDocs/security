# Develop using Zero Trust principles

This article helps you, as a developer, to understand the guiding principles of Zero Trust so that you can improve your application security. You play a key role in organizational security; applications and their developers can no longer assume that the network perimeter is secure. Compromised applications can affect the entire organization.

Organizations are deploying new security models that adapt to complex modern environments and embrace the mobile workforce. New models are designed protect people, devices, applications, and data wherever they're located. Organizations are striving to achieve [Zero Trust](../zero-trust-overview.md), a security strategy and approach for designing and implementing applications that follow these guiding principles:

* Verify explicitly
* Use least privilege access
* Assume breach

Instead of believing everything behind the corporate firewall is safe, the Zero Trust model assumes breach and verifies each request as though it originated from an uncontrolled network. Regardless of where the request originates or what resource it accesses, the Zero Trust model requires us to "never trust, always verify."

Understand that Zero Trust isn't a replacement for security fundamentals. With work originating from anywhere on any device, design your applications to incorporate Zero Trust principles throughout your development cycle.

## Why develop with a Zero Trust perspective?

* We've seen a rise in the level of sophistication of cybersecurity attacks.
* The "work from anywhere" workforce has redefined the security perimeter. Data is being accessed outside the corporate network and shared with external collaborators such as partners and vendors.
* Corporate applications and data are moving from on-premises to hybrid and cloud environments. Traditional network controls can no longer be relied on for security. Controls need to move to where the data is: on devices and inside apps.

The development guidance in this section helps you to increase security, reduce the blast radius of a security incident, and swiftly recover by using Microsoft technology.

* [Supported identity and account types for single- and multi-tenant apps](identity-supported-account-types.md) explains how you can choose if your app allows only users from your Microsoft Entra tenant, any Microsoft Entra tenant, or users with personal Microsoft accounts.
* [Authenticating users for Zero Trust](user-authentication.md) helps developers to learn best practices for authenticating application users in Zero Trust application development. It describes how to enhance application security with the Zero Trust principles of least privilege and verify explicitly.

* [Requesting permissions that require administrative consent](permissions-require-admin-consent.md) describes the permission and consent experience when application permissions require administrative consent.
* [Reducing overprivileged permissions and apps](overprivileged-permissions.md) helps you to understand why applications shouldn't request more permissions than they need (overprivileged) and how to limit privilege to manage access and improve security.
* [Providing application identity credentials when there's no user](identity-non-user-applications.md) explains why the best Zero Trust client credentials practice for services (non-user applications) on Azure is Managed Identities for Azure resources.
* [Managing tokens for Zero Trust](token-management.md) helps developers to build security into applications with ID tokens, access tokens, and security tokens that your they can receive from the Microsoft identity platform.
