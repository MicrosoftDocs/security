# Overview

The [Secure Future Initiative (SFI) initiative](secure-future-initiative-overview.md) launched in November 2023 as a multiyear effort to increasingly secure the way in which Microsoft designs, builds, tests, and operates its products and services.

SFI architecture design focuses on a set of security principles that are adopted and integrated into Microsoft culture and governance. These security principles are applied to a set of engineering pillars by means of processes, standards, and continuous improvements.

This article summarizes the "Accelerate response and remediation" SFI pillar.

## Before you start

- [Review](secure-future-initiative-overview.md#sfi-pillars-zero-trust-and-nist) the SFI pillars
- [Review tthe latest progress on pillar objectives](secure-future-initiative-whats-new.md#pillar-progress) in What's New.


## Pillar and objectives 

The aim of this pillar is to quickly contain threats, restore trust, and improve resilience. It aims to minimize the impact and duration of security events and attacker dwell time in internal networks.


Microsoft objectives for this pillar are summarized in the following table. You can see how each objective maps toZero Trust principles, and to  [NIST CSF functions and categories](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.29.pdf).


**Objective** | **Details**
--- | ---
**1. Accelerate vulnerability mitigation** | Reduce "Time to Mitigation" for high-severity cloud security vulnerabilities with accelerated response.
**2. Transparency of cloud vulnerabilities** | Increase transparency of mitigated cloud vulnerabilities with the adoption and release of Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) industry standards. Release high severity Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) affecting the cloud.
**3. Enhance public messaging and engagement** | Improve the accuracy, effectiveness, transparency, and velocity of public messaging and customer engagement.
