# DoD Zero Trust Strategy for the device pillar

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Zero Trust Portfolio Management Office (ZT PfMO) was established to orchestrate DoD-wide Zero Trust adoption and execution. In November 2022, the DoD ZT PfMO released the [DoD Zero Trust Strategy and Roadmap](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3225919/department-of-defense-releases-zero-trust-strategy-and-roadmap/). 

The strategy and accompanying execution plans outline a path to adopt a new cybersecurity framework to facilitate well-informed, risk-based decisions. This model incorporates Zero Trust principles by eliminating traditional perimeters and trust assumptions, enabling a more efficient architecture that enhances security, user experience, and mission performance. The Zero Trust Framework aims to minimize DoD attack surface, reduce risks, enable effective data-sharing and collaboration, proactively safeguard its technical estate, and disrupt adversarial activities.

The DoD Zero Trust Strategy covers seven pillars representing protection areas for Zero Trust. Use the following links to go to sections of the guide.

## 2.2 Device detection and compliance

Microsoft Intune compliance policies ensure devices comply with organizational standards. Compliance policies can assess device configuration against a security baseline. Policies use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint protection state, and machine risk score, to determine compliance. Conditional Access uses device compliance state to make dynamic access decisions for users and devices, including bring-your-own-devices (BYOD).

|DoD Activity Description and Outcome|Microsoft guidance and recommendations|
|---|---|
|`Target` **2.2.1 Implement C2C/Compliance Based Network Authorization Pt1**</br>The DoD enterprise working with the Organizations develops a policy, standard, and requirements for Comply to Connect.

## 2.3 Device authorization with real time inspection

Conditional Access is the Zero Trust policy engine for Microsoft cloud products and services. Evaluating Zero Trust policies at the IdP advances the comply-to-connect (C2C) model by applying adaptive controls before resource access. Conditional Access policies use security signals from Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft Defender XDR, and Microsoft Intune.

Microsoft Defender XDR components assess device and identity risk levels by using machine learning (ML) detections, and by enabling dynamic, risk-based decisions to allow, block, or control access to data, applications, assets, and services (DAAS).

## 2.4 Remote access

Microsoft Entra ID is a deny-by-default identity provider (IdP). If you use Microsoft Entra for application sign-in, users authenticate and pass Conditional Access policy checks before Microsoft Entra authorizes access. You can use Microsoft Entra ID to protect applications hosted in the cloud or on-premises.

|DoD Activity Description and Outcome|Microsoft guidance and recommendations|

## 2.5 Partially and fully automated asset, vulnerability, and patch management

Microsoft Endpoint Manager supports cloud-based and hybrid (co-management) solutions for device management. Configuration and compliance policies ensure devices meet the patch level and security configuration requirements for your organization.

|DoD Activity Description and Outcome|Microsoft guidance and recommendations|
|---|---|
|`Target` **2.5.1 Implement Asset, Vulnerability, and Patch Management Tools**</br>DoD Organizations implement solution(s) for managing assets/devices configurations, vulnerabilities, and patches.

## 2.6 Unified endpoint management and mobile device management

Microsoft Intune configuration and compliance policies ensure devices meet organizational security configuration requirements. Intune evaluates compliance policies and marks devices as compliant or noncompliant. Conditional Access policies can use device compliance state to block users with noncompliant devices from accessing resources protected by Microsoft Entra ID.

Use Microsoft Entra External ID to manage trust settings, per tenant, for external guest users collaborating in your tenant. Use inbound trust settings to require MFA and compliant devices in Conditional Access for all users. You don’t need to make exceptions to Conditional Access policies to avoid blocking external guests

## 2.7 Endpoint and extended detection and response (EDR and XDR)

The Microsoft Defender XDR unified defense suite coordinates detection, prevention, investigation, and response across endpoints, identities, email, and applications. Microsoft Defender XDR components detect and defend against sophisticated attacks.

Integration of Microsoft Defender XDR components extends protection beyond devices. See example detection events that contribute to user risk level in Microsoft Entra ID Protection:

* Suspicious email-sending patterns detected by Microsoft Defender for Office
* Impossible travel detections in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps
* Attempts to access the primary refresh token detected by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

Risk-based Conditional Access policies can secure, limit, or block access to cloud services for the risky user, even if they use a compliant device on a trusted network.

|DoD Activity Description and Outcome|Microsoft guidance and recommendations|
|---|---|
|`Target` **2.7.1 Implement Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) Tools and Integrate with C2C**</br>DoD Organizations procure and implement Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution(s) within environments. EDR is protecting, monitoring, and responding to malicious and anomalous activities enabling ZT Target functionality and is sending data to the Comply to Connection solution for expanded device and user checks. </br></br>**Outcomes**:</br>- Endpoint Detection & Response Tooling is implemented</br>- Critical EDR data is being sent to C2C for checks</br>- NextGen AV tooling covers maximum amount of services/applications|**Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**</br>Deploy Defender for Endpoint for end user devices.</br></br>See Microsoft guidance [2.3.1](#23-device-authorization-with-real-time-inspection) in this section.</br></br>**Microsoft Intune**</br>Configure Intune device compliance policies.

|`Target`  **2.7.2 Implement Extended Detection & Response (XDR) Tools and Integrate with C2C Pt1**</br>DoD Organizations procure and implement Extended Detection & Response (XDR) solution(s). Integration points with cross pillar capabilities are identified and prioritized based on risk. The riskiest of these integration points are actioned and integration is started. EDR continues coverage of endpoints to include the maximum number of services and applications as part of the XDR implementation. Basic analytics are sent from the XDR solution stack to the SIEM. </br></br>**Outcomes**:</br>- Integration Points have been identified per Capability</br>- Riskiest integration points have been integrated w/ XDR</br>- Basic alerting is in place with SIEM and/or other mechanisms|**Microsoft Defender XDR**</br>Pilot and deploy Microsoft Defender XDR components and services.</br>- [Defender XDR](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-365-defender?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true)</br>- [Sentinel and Defender XDR for Zero Trust](/security/operations/siem-xdr-overview)</br></br>Configure integrations of deployed Microsoft Defender XDR components.</br>- [Defender for Endpoint with Defender for Cloud Apps](/defender-cloud-apps/mde-integration)</br>- [Defender for Identity and Defender for Cloud Apps](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-365-security-center-mdi?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true)</br>- [Purview Information Protection and Defender for Cloud Apps](/defender-cloud-apps/azip-integration)</br></br>Configure Sentinel data connectors for Microsoft Defender XDR.

Exceptions are tracked and managed using a risk based methodical approach for continued operation. Extended analytics enabling ZT Advanced functionalities are integrated into the SIEM and other appropriate solutions. </br></br>**Outcomes**:</br>- Remaining integration points have been integrated as appropriate</br>- Extended alerting and response is enabled with other Analytics tools at least using SIEM</br></br>|**Complete activity 2.7.2**</br></br>**Microsoft Defender XDR**</br>Use Microsoft Defender XDR in your security operations strategy.</br>- [Integrate Defender XDR into security ops](/microsoft-365/security/defender/integrate-microsoft-365-defender-secops?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true)|
