# What's new in the Secure Future Initiative

The Secure Future Initiative (SFI) initiative launched in November 2023 as a multiyear effort to increasingly secure the way in which Microsoft designs, builds, tests, and operates its products and services. For the first year or so after the launch, we shifted to security as a number one priority across Microsoft, provided security training, and dedicated extensive internal engineering resources to improve security and mitigate risk across Microsoft.

Over time, SFI efforts continue to evolve as a cross-company initiative in structured waves, keeping pace with shifts in the threat landscape. This a

## SFI pillars, Zero Trust, NIST

The SFI initiative focuses on six prioritized engineering pillars. Multiple objectives are aligned with each pillar. Each objective represents a significant effort to improve security and reduce risk for Microsoft and our customers in a specific pillar area.

 Microsoft discloses the progress of these objectives against principles and pillars in our periodic SFI reports. Goals and objectives might shift over time in response to dynamic security priorities and emerging threat landscapes.

The pillars and objectives clearly align with Microsoft's Zero Trust principles and the [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework). NIST functions referenced in the table are as follows:

- Govern (GV): Establish policies, procedures, and culture for managing cybersecurity risk, aligning it with overall business strategy and outcomes of the other NIST functions.
- Identify (ID): Understand assets, systems, data, and potential threats to build a strong organizational understanding of cyber risk.
- Protect (PR): Implement safeguards like access controls, data security, and training to ensure critical services can be delivered.
- Detect (DE): Develop and implement activities to identify the occurrence of cybersecurity events, such as continuous monitoring.
- Respond (RS): Take action regarding a detected incident, including analysis, containment, eradication, and communication.
- Recover (RC): Restore systems and operations post-incident, emphasizing planning, communication, and improvement to minimize disruption.

Isolate high-value assets and enforce strict egress control. | **Identify (ID)**: Inventory and understand networking assets.<br/><br/>**Protect (PR)**: Apply network security controls (segementation, encryption etc).
**4. Protect engineering systems**<br/> Secure the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC) and delivery lifecycle by ensuring that code, build systems, and pipelines are tamper-resistant, auditable, and trustworthy.  | **Verify explicitly**: Authenticate every action in the SDLC, from code commits to builds, with traceable, signed identities.<br/>**Use least privilege**: Restrict developer, agent, and pipeline access based on role and build context.<br/><br/>**Assume breach**: Segregate build systems and enforce code signed and reproducible builds to prevent tampering. | **Identify (ID)**: Understand build/test/deployment systems and dependencies.<br/><br/>**Protect (PR)**: Secure software pipelines, development tooling and artifacts.<br/><br/>**Govern (GV)**: Apply engineering policies, standards, secure design.

Protect engineering systems | **5. Protect the software supply chain**<br/><br/>Secure the software supply chain to protect Microsoft production environments.| Supply chain protections are maturing: internal artifact feeds broadly adopted and component governance runs by default. AI agents now remediate open‑source vulnerabilities asynchronously, reducing detection‑to‑resolution latency.
Monitor and detect threats<br/><br/>Get [full progress details](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/microsoft/bade/documents/products-and-services/en-us/security/sfi-nov-2025-progress-report.pdf#page=31) in the November 2025 report. | **1.

Monitor and detect threats | **2. Standardize security log retention.**<br/><br/>Retain security logs for at least two years, and make six months of appropriate logs available.|  More than 72% of services are now fully compliant with our standardized  logging format, ensuring critical security events are captured in a uniform  and actionable way. To accelerate adoption across the remaining services,  we are investing in AI-driven analysis of service code repositories and  function calls. We're also continually refining our standard logging baselines dynamically in response to security incident learning.
Monitor and detect threats | **3. Centralize access to security logs**<br/><br/> Ensure security logs are accessible from a central data lake for efficient and effective investigation and threat hunting. | To strengthen our threat detection and response capabilities, we have  implemented a robust and scalable access model that enables security  teams to efficiently retrieve and analyze logs for investigations and threat  hunting. As of this update, the centralized access model for security logs  has matured, with 6 out of 7 major log categories now following the  minimum retention standards.
Monitor and detect threats | **3. Detect and respond quickly**<br/><br/> Detect and respond automatically to anomalous access, behavior, and configurations across Microsoft production infrastructure and services. | As part of our broader strategy to continuously evaluate detection  coverage, identify gaps, and stay ahead of emerging threats security and  engineering collaborated to expand and refine our detection capabilities  resulting in the deployment of more than 50 new detections targeting  high-priority TTPs (including data exfiltration, credential access, and  remote code execution). This brings our total to more than 250 active  detections across production infrastructure – applicable detections will be  added to Microsoft Defender.  
Accelerate response and remediation<br/><br/>Get [full progress details](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/microsoft/bade/documents/products-and-services/en-us/security/sfi-nov-2025-progress-report.pdf#page=33) in the November 2025 report. | **1. Accelerate vulnerability mitigation**<br/><br/> Reduce "Time to Mitigation" for high-severity cloud security vulnerabilities with accelerated response. | AI-based vulnerability triage and expedited software processes, supported by signal intelligence that processes over 100 trillion signals every day, has strengthened our ability to accurately identify and assign vulnerabilities to the correct internal teams. The result is faster remediation and more efficient resolution of critical vulnerabilities, resulting in a 72% success rate, as we expanded the program’s scope and mitigated more vulnerabilities.
Accelerate response and remediation | **2. Advance transparency of cloud vulnerabilities**<br/><br/>Increase transparency of mitigated cloud vulnerabilities with the adoption and release of Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) industry standards. Release high severity Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) affecting the cloud. | We have published 1,096 CVEs, with 53 no-action cloud CVEs, since January 2025. Internal Microsoft researchers discovered more than 48% of these vulnerabilities. The adoption of industry standards enables customers and the broader ecosystem to better understand root causes and impacted products. Investments in bounty programs and live hacking events, such as the Zero Day Quest, further demonstrate our commitment to openness and proactive security improvements across key cloud environments.
Accelerate response and remediation | **3. Enhance public messaging and engagement**<br/><br/>Improve the accuracy, effectiveness, transparency, and velocity of public messaging and customer engagement. | The CSMO has improved customer engagement and incident communication by partnering with internal Microsoft Support and Security Resilience teams. By standardizing incident communications, the CSMO has increased speed and transparency in response efforts. These advances, combined with expanded executive engagement and collaboration with global security advisors, help ensure rapid, effective public messaging and proactive customer engagement during security incidents. Additionally, the CSMO proactively notifies customers of critical risks, ensuring CISOs receive timely updates.
