# Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architectures

The Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architectures (MCRA) are the component of [Microsoft's Security Adoption Framework (SAF)](/security/ciso-workshop/adoption) that describe Microsoft’s cybersecurity capabilities and technologies. The diagrams describe how Microsoft security capabilities integrate with Microsoft platforms and third party platforms like:

- Microsoft 365
- Microsoft Azure
- Third party apps like ServiceNow and Salesforce
- Third party platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- First and third party AI capabilities

## What does the MCRA include?

The MCRA includes key information about:

- Antipatterns (common mistakes) and best practices
- Guiding rulesets for end to end architecture
- Threat trends, and attack patterns
- Mapping Microsoft capabilities to organizational roles
- Mapping Microsoft capabilities to Zero Trust standards
- Securing privileged access
- Reference plans in SAF (including example of patching modernization)
- Prioritizing using attacker return on investment (ROI)
- ...and more

The MCRA also includes detailed technical diagrams for:

- Microsoft cybersecurity capabilities
- Zero trust user access
- Security operations (SecOps/SOC)
- Operational technology (OT)
- Multicloud and cross-platform capabilities
- Attack chain coverage
- Infrastructure and Development Security
- Security organizational functions

## How to use the MCRA

We see this resource used for several purposes including

- **Starting template for a security architecture** - The most common use case we see is that organizations use the document to help define a target state for cybersecurity capabilities.
Organizations find this architecture useful because it covers capabilities across the modern enterprise estate that now spans on-premises, mobile devices, multiple clouds, and IoT / Operational Technology.
- **Comparison reference for security capabilities** - Some organizations use this resource to compare Microsoft's recommendations with what they already own and have implemented. Many organizations find that they already own quite a bit of this technology already and weren't aware of it.
- **Learn about Microsoft capabilities** - We also see this resource used as a learning tool. In presentation mode, each capability has a "ScreenTip" with a short description of each capability + a link to documentation to learn more.
- **Learn about Microsoft's integration investments** - The architecture helps architects and technical teams identify how to take advantage of integration points within Microsoft capabilities and with existing security capabilities.
- **Learn about Cybersecurity** - Some folks, particularly people new to cybersecurity, use this resource as a learning tool as they prepare for their first career or a career change.
