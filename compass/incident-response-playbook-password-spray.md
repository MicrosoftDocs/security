# Password spray investigation

This article provides guidance on identifying and investigating password spray attacks within your organization and take the required remedial action to protect information and minimize further risks.

This article contains the following sections:

- **Prerequisites:** Covers the specific requirements you need to complete before starting the investigation. For example, logging that should be turned on, roles and permissions required, among others.
- **Workflow:** Shows the logical flow that you should follow to perform this investigation.
- **Checklist:** Contains a list of tasks for each of the steps in the flow chart. This checklist can be helpful in highly regulated environments to verify what you have done or simply as a quality gate for yourself.
- **Investigation steps:** Includes a detailed step-by-step guidance for this specific investigation.
- **Recovery:** Contains high-level steps on how to recover/mitigate from a password spray attack.
- **References:** Contains additional reading and reference materials.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the investigation, make sure you have completed the setup for logs and alerts and additional system requirements.

For Azure AD monitoring follow our recommendations and guidance in our [Azure AD SecOps Guide](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/security-operations-introduction).

### Set up [ADFS logging](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/troubleshooting/ad-fs-tshoot-logging)

#### Event logging on ADFS 2016

By default, the Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) in Windows Server 2016 has a basic level of auditing enabled. With basic auditing, administrators can see five or less events for a single request. Set logging to the highest level and send the AD FS (& security) logs to a SIEM to correlate with AD authentication as well as Azure AD.

To view the current auditing level, you can use this PowerShell command:

```powershell
Get-AdfsProperties
```

![adfs](./media/incident-response-playbook-password-spray/adfsproperties.png)

This table contains the auditing levels that are available.

| **Audit level** | **PowerShell syntax** | **Description** |
|-----------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|
| None            | Set-AdfsProperties -AuditLevel - None    | Auditing is disabled and no events will be logged                                         |
| Basic (Default) | Set-AdfsProperties -AuditLevel - Basic   | No more than 5 events will be logged for a single request                                 |
| Verbose         | Set-AdfsProperties -AuditLevel - Verbose | All events will be logged. This will log a significant amount of information per request. |

To raise or lower the auditing level, use this PowerShell command:

```powershell
Set-AdfsProperties -AuditLevel
```

### Set up ADFS 2012 R2/2016/2019 security logging

1. Click **Start**, navigate to **Programs &gt; Administrative Tools**, and then click **Local Security Policy**.
2. Navigate to the **Security Settings\\Local Policies\\User Rights Management** folder, and then double-click **Generate security audits**.
3. On the **Local Security Setting** tab, verify that the ADFS service account is listed. If it is not present, click **Add User** or **Group** and add it to the list, and then click **OK**.
4. To enable auditing, open a command prompt with elevated privileges and run the following command:

    ```powershell
    auditpol.exe /set /subcategory:"Application Generated" /failure:enable /success:enable
    ```

5. Close **Local Security Policy**.
6. Next, open the ADFS Management snap-in, click **Start**, navigate to **Programs > Administrative Tools**, and then click **ADFS Management**.
7. In the **Actions** pane, click **Edit Federation Service Properties**.
8. In the **Federation Service Properties** dialog box, click the **Events** tab.
9. Select the **Success audits** and **Failure audits** check boxes.
10. Click **OK** to finish and save the configuration.

### Install Azure AD Connect Health for ADFS

The Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Connect Health for ADFS agent allows you to have greater visibility into your federation environment. It provides you with several pre-configured dashboards like usage, performance monitoring as well as risky IP reports.

To install ADFS Connect Health, go through the [requirements for using Azure AD Connect Health](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-health-agent-install#requirements), and then install the [Azure ADFS Connect Health Agent](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=518973).

### Set up risky IP alerts using the [ADFS Risky IP Report Workbook](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-health-adfs-risky-ip-workbook#:~:text=The%20risky%20IP%20workbook%20analyzes%20data%20from%20ADFSSignInLogs,on%20designated%20error%20thresholds%20and%20detection%20window%20length.)

After Azure AD Connect Health for ADFS is configured, you should monitor and set up alerting using the ADFS Risky IP report workbook and Azure Monitor. The benefits of using this report are:

- Detection of IP addresses that exceed a threshold of failed password-based logins.
- Supports failed logins due to bad password or due to extranet lockout state.
- Supports enabling alerts through Azure Alerts.
- Customizable threshold settings that match with the security policy of an organization.
- Customizable queries and expanded visualizations for further analysis.
- Expanded functionality from the previous Risky IP report, which will be deprecated after January 24, 2022.

### Set up SIEM tool alerts on Microsoft Sentinel

To set up SIEM tool alerts, go through the tutorial on [out of the box alerting](/azure/sentinel/tutorial-detect-threats-built-in).

### SIEM integration into Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps

Connect the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool to Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, which currently supports Micro Focus ArcSight and generic common event format (CEF).

For more information, see [Generic SIEM Integration](/cloud-app-security/siem).

### SIEM integration with Graph API

You can connect SIEM with the Microsoft Graph Security API by using any of the following options:

- **Directly using the supported integration options** – Refer to the list of supported integration options like writing code to directly connect your application to derive rich insights. Leverage samples to get started.
- **Use native integrations and connectors built by Microsoft partners** – Refer to the Microsoft Graph Security API partner solutions to use these integrations.
- **Use connectors built by Microsoft** – Refer to the list of connectors that you can use to connect with the API through a variety of solutions for Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM), Security Response and Orchestration (SOAR), Incident Tracking and Service Management (ITSM), reporting, and so on.

For more information, see [security solution integrations using the Microsoft Graph Security API](/graph/security-integration#list-of-connectors-from-microsoft).

### Using Splunk

You can also use the Splunk platform to set up alerts.

- Watch this video tutorial on how to create [Splunk alerts](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/resources/videos/splunk-tutorial-creating-alerts-in-splunk-enterprise-6.html)
- For more information, see [Splunk alerting manual](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.0.4/Alert/AlertWorkflowOverview)

## Checklist

#### Investigation triggers

- Received a trigger from SIEM, firewall logs, or Azure AD
- Azure AD Identity Protection Password Spray feature or Risky IP
- Large number of failed sign-ins (Event ID 411)
- Spike in Azure AD Connect Health for ADFS
- Another security incident (for example, phishing)
- Unexplained activity, such as a sign-in from unfamiliar location or a user getting unexpected MFA prompts

### Investigation

- What is being alerted?
- Can you confirm this is a password spray?
- Determine timeline for attack.
- Determine the IP address(es) of the attack.
- Filter on successful sign-ins for this time period and IP address, including successful password but failed MFA
- Check [MFA reporting](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-reporting)
- Is there anything out of the ordinary on the account, such as new device, new OS, new IP address used? Use Defender for Cloud Apps or Azure Information Protection to detect suspicious activity.
- Inform local authorities/third parties for assistance.
- If you suspect a compromise, check for data exfiltration.
- Check associated account for suspicious behavior and look to correlate to other possible accounts and services as well as other malicious IP addresses.
- Check accounts of anyone working in the same office/delegated access - password hygiene (make sure they are not using the same password as the compromised account)
- Run ADFS help

#### Mitigations

## Investigation steps

### Password spray incident response

Let’s understand a few password spray attack techniques before proceeding with the investigation.

**Password compromise:** An attacker has successfully guessed the user’s password but has not been able to access the account due to other controls such as multi-factor authentication (MFA).

**Account compromise:** An attacker has successfully guessed the user’s password and has successfully gained access to the account.

### Environment discovery

#### Identify authentication type

As the very first step, you need to check what authentication type is used for a tenant/verified domain that you are investigating.

To obtain the authentication status for a specific domain name, use the [Get-MsolDomain](/powershell/module/msonline/get-msoldomain) PowerShell command. Here's an example:

```powershell
Connect-MsolService
Get-MsolDomain -DomainName "contoso.com"
```

### Is the authentication federated or managed?

If the authentication is federated, then successful sign-ins will be stored in Azure AD. The failed sign-ins will be in their Identity Provider (IDP). For more information, see  [ADFS troubleshooting and event logging](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/troubleshooting/ad-fs-tshoot-logging).

If the authentication type is managed, (Cloud only, password hash sync (PHS) or pass-through authentication (PTA)), then successful and failed sign-ins will be stored in the Azure AD sign-in logs.

>[!Note]
>The [Staged Rollout](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-staged-rollout) feature allows the tenant domain name to be federated but specific users to be managed. Determine if any users are members of this group.
>

### Is Azure AD Connect Health enabled for ADFS?

- The [RiskyIP report](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-health-adfs-risky-ip)  will provide suspect IPs and date/time. Notifications should be enabled.
- Also check the [federated sign-ins investigation from the Phishing playbook](incident-response-playbook-phishing.md#federated-scenario)

### Is the advanced logging enabled in ADFS?

- This is a requirement for ADFS Connect Health but it can be enabled independently
- See how to [enable ADFS Health Connect](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-health-agent-install#installing-the-azure-ad-connect-health-agent-for-ad-fs))
- Also check the [Federated sign-ins investigation from the Phishing playbook](incident-response-playbook-phishing.md#federated-scenario)

### Are the logs stored in SIEM?

To check whether you are storing and correlating logs in a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) or in any other system, check the following:

- Log analytics- pre-built queries
- Sentinel- pre-built queries
- Splunk – pre-built queries
- Firewall logs
- UAL if > 30 days

### Understanding Azure AD and MFA reporting

It is important that you understand the logs that you are seeing to be able to determine compromise. Below are our quick guides to understanding Azure AD Sign-Ins and MFA reporting to help with this. Refer to these articles:

- [MFA reporting](</azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-reporting>)
- [Understanding Sign Ins](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-sign-ins)

### Incident triggers

An incident trigger is an event or a series of events that causes predefined alert to trigger. An example of this is the number of bad password attempts has gone above your predefined threshold. Below are further examples of triggers that can be alerted in password spray attacks and where these alerts are surfaced. Incident triggers include:

- Users
- IP
- User agent strings
- Date/time
- Anomalies
- Bad password attempts
    
    :::image type="content" source="./media/incident-response-playbook-password-spray/Badpwdattempt.jpg" alt-text="pwdattempts"::: 
    *Graph depicting number of bad password attempts*

Unusual spikes in activity are key indicators through Azure AD Health Connect (assuming this is installed). Other indicators are:

- Alerting through SIEM shows a spike when you collate the logs.
- Larger than normal log size for ADFS failed sign-ins (this can be an alert in SIEM tool).
- Increased amounts of 342/411 event IDs – username or password is incorrect. Or 516 for extranet lockout.
- Hit failed authentication request threshold – Risky IP in Azure AD or SIEM tool alert/both 342 and 411 errors (To be able to view this information, the advanced logging should be turned on.)

### Risky IP in Azure AD Health Connect portal

Risky IP will alert when the customized threshold has been reached for bad passwords in an hour and bad password count in a day as well as extranet lockouts.

![Example of risky IP report data](./media/incident-response-playbook-password-spray/RiskyIPReport.jpg)

*Risky IP report data*

The details of failed attempts are available in the tabs **IP address** and **extranet lockouts**.

![ipaddresstable](./media/incident-response-playbook-password-spray/ipaddress1.png)

*IP address and extranet lockouts in the Risky IP report*

### Detect password spray in Azure Identity Protection

Azure Identity Protection is an Azure AD Premium P2 feature that has a password-spray detection risk alert and search feature that you can utilize to get additional information or set up automatic remediation.

:::image type="content" source="./media/incident-response-playbook-password-spray/Detectpwd.png" alt-text="Example of password spray attack":::

*Details of a password spray attack*

### Low and slow attack indicators

Low and slow attack indicators are those where thresholds for account lockout or bad passwords are not being hit. You can detect these indicators through:

- Failures in GAL order
- Failures with repetitive attributes (UA, target AppID, IP block/location)
- Timing – automated sprays tend to have a more regular time interval between attempts.

### Investigation and mitigation

>[!Note]
>You can perform investigation and mitigation simultaneously during sustained/ongoing attacks.
>

1. Turn advanced logging on ADFS if it is not already turned on.
2. Determine the date and time of start of the attack.
3. Determine the attacker IP address (might be multiple sources and multiple IP addresses) from the firewall, ADFS, SIEM or Azure AD.
4. Once password spray confirmed, you might have to inform the local agencies (police, third parties, among others).
5. Collate and monitor the following Event IDs for ADFS:

    **ADFS 2012 R2**

    - Audit event 403 – user agent making the request
    - Audit event 411 – failed authentication requests
    - Audit event 516 – extranet lockout
    - Audit Event 342 – failed authentication requests
    - Audit Event 412 - Successful log in

6. To collect the *Audit Event 411 - failed authentication requests,* use the following [script](/samples/browse/?redirectedfrom=TechNet-Gallery):

    ```powershell
    PARAM ($PastDays = 1, $PastHours) 
    #************************************************ 
    #ADFSBadCredsSearch.ps1 
    #Version 1.0 
    #Date: 6-20-2016 
    #Author: Tim Springston [MSFT] 
    #Description: This script will parse the ADFS server's (not proxy) security ADFS 
    #for events which indicate an incorrectly entered username or password. The script can specify a 
    #past period to search the log for and it defaults to the past 24 hours. Results >#will be placed into a CSV for  
    #review of UPN, IP address of submitter, and timestamp.  
    #************************************************ 
    cls 
    if ($PastHours -gt 0) 
    {$PastPeriod = (Get-Date).AddHours(-($PastHours))} 
    else 
    {$PastPeriod = (Get-Date).AddDays(-($PastDays))    } 
    $Outputfile = $Pwd.path + "\BadCredAttempts.csv" 
    $CS = get-wmiobject -class win32_computersystem 
    $Hostname = $CS.Name + '.' + $CS.Domain 
    $Instances = @{} 
    $OSVersion = gwmi win32_operatingsystem 
    [int]$BN = $OSVersion.Buildnumber  
    if ($BN -lt 9200){$ADFSLogName = "AD FS 2.0/Admin"} 
    else {$ADFSLogName = "AD FS/Admin"} 
    $Users = @() 
    $IPAddresses = @() 
    $Times = @() 
    $AllInstances = @() 
    Write-Host "Searching event log for bad credential events..." 
    if ($BN -ge 9200) {Get-Winevent  -FilterHashTable @{LogName= "Security"; >StartTime=$PastPeriod; ID=411} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Where-Object{$_.Message -match "The user name or password is incorrect"} |  % { 
    $Instance = New-Object PSObject 
    $UPN = $_.Properties[2].Value 
    $UPN = $UPN.Split("-")[0] 
    $IPAddress = $_.Properties[4].Value 
    $Users += $UPN 
    $IPAddresses += $IPAddress 
    $Times += $_.TimeCreated 
    add-member -inputobject $Instance -membertype noteproperty -name >"UserPrincipalName" -value $UPN 
    add-member -inputobject $Instance -membertype noteproperty -name "IP Address" ->value $IPAddress 
    add-member -inputobject $Instance -membertype noteproperty -name "Time" -value >($_.TimeCreated).ToString() 
    $AllInstances += $Instance 
    $Instance = $null 
    } 
    } 
    $AllInstances | select * | Export-Csv -Path $Outputfile -append -force ->NoTypeInformation  
    Write-Host "Data collection finished. The output file can be found at >$outputfile`." 
    $AllInstances = $null
    ```

#### ADFS 2016/2019

Along with the above event IDs, collate the *Audit Event 1203 – Fresh Credential Validation Error*.

1. Collate all successful sign-ins for this time on ADFS (if federated). A quick sign-in and logout (at the same second) can be an indicator of a password being guessed successfully and being tried by the attacker.
2. Collate any Azure AD successful or interrupted events for this time-period for both federated and managed scenarios.

### Monitor and collate Event IDs from Azure AD

See how to find the [meaning of error logs](https://login.microsoftonline.com/error).  

The following Event IDs from Azure AD are relevant:

- 50057 - User account was disabled
- 50055 - Password expired
- 50072 – User prompted to provide MFA
- 50074 - MFA required
- 50079 - user needs to register security info
- 53003 - User blocked by Conditional Access
- 53004 - Cannot configure MFA due to suspicious activity
- 530032 - Blocked by Conditional Access on Security Policy
- Sign-In status Success, Failure, Interrupt

### Collate event IDs from Sentinel playbook

You can get all the Event IDs from the Sentinel Playbook that is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/49fee965c9def6890b7e5f2ad96cc1a89d73db26/Detections/SigninLogs/SigninPasswordSpray.yaml).

### Isolate and confirm attack

Isolate the ADFS and Azure AD successful and interrupted sign-in events. These are your accounts of interest.

Block the IP Address ADFS 2012R2 and above for federated authentication. Here's an example:

```powershell
Set-AdfsProperties -AddBannedIps "1.2.3.4", "::3", "1.2.3.4/16"
```

### **Collect ADFS logs**

Collect multiple event IDs within a time frame. Here's an example:

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -ProviderName 'ADFS' | Where-Object { $_.ID -eq '412' -or $_.ID -eq '411' -or $_.ID -eq '342' -or $_.ID -eq '516' -and $_.TimeCreated -gt ((Get-Date).AddHours(-"8")) }
```

### Collate ADFS logs in Azure AD

Azure AD Sign-In reports include ADFS sign-in activity when you use Azure AD Connect Health. Filter sign-in logs by Token Issuer Type "Federated".

Here’s an example PowerShell command to retrieve sign-in logs for a specific IP address:

```powershell
Get-AzureADIRSignInDetail -TenantId b446a536-cb76-4360-a8bb-6593cf4d9c7f -IpAddress 131.107.128.76
```

Also, search the Azure portal for time frame, IP address and successful and interrupted sign-in as shown in these images.

:::image type="content" source="./media/incident-response-playbook-password-spray/Selectingtimeframe.jpg" alt-text="timeframe"::: 

*Searching for sign-ins within a specific time frame*

:::image type="content" source="./media/incident-response-playbook-password-spray/Selectingipaddress.jpg" alt-text="ipaddress"::: 

*Searching for sign-ins on a specific IP address*

:::image type="content" source="./media/incident-response-playbook-password-spray/Selectingstatus.jpg" alt-text="status"::: 

*Searching for sign-ins based on the status*

You can then download this data as a *.csv* file for analysis. For more information, see [Sign-in activity reports in the Azure Active Directory portal](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-sign-ins).

### Prioritize findings

It is important to be able to react to the most critical threat. This can be the attacker has successfully obtained access to an account and therefore can access/exfiltrate data. The attacker has the password but may not be able to access the account for example they have the password but are not passing the MFA challenge. Also, the attacker could not be guessing passwords correctly but continuing to try. During analysis, prioritize these findings:

- Successful sign-ins by known attacker IP address
- Interrupted sign-in by known attacker IP address
- Unsuccessful sign-ins by known attacker IP address
- Other unknown IP address successful sign-ins

### Check legacy authentication

Most attacks use legacy authentication. There are a number of ways to determine the protocol of the attack.

1. In Azure AD, navigate to **Sign-Ins** and filter on **Client App.**
2. Select all the legacy authentication protocols that are listed.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/incident-response-playbook-password-spray/Legacyauthenticationchecks.jpg" alt-text="authenticationcheck"::: 
 
    *List of legacy protocols*

3. Or if you have an Azure workspace, you can use the pre-built legacy authentication workbook located in the Azure Active Directory portal under **Monitoring and Workbooks**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/incident-response-playbook-password-spray/authenticationbook.png" alt-text="workbook"::: 

    *Legacy authentication workbook*

### Block IP address Azure AD for managed scenario (PHS including staging)

1. Navigate to **New named locations**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/incident-response-playbook-password-spray/Namedlocation.jpg" alt-text="Example of a new named location"::: 

2. Create a CA policy to target all applications and block for this named location only.

### Has the user used this operating system, IP, ISP, device, or browser before?

If the user has not used them before and this activity is unusual, then flag the user and investigate all of their activities.

### Is the IP marked as “risky”?  

Ensure you record successful passwords but failed multi-factor authentication (MFA) responses, as this activity indicates that the attacker is getting the password but not passing MFA.  
Set aside any account that appears to be a normal sign-in, for example, passed MFA, location and IP not out of the ordinary.

### MFA reporting

It is important to also check MFA logs as an attacker could have successfully guessed a password but be failing the MFA prompt. The Azure AD MFA logs shows authentication details for events when a user is prompted for multi-factor authentication. Check and make sure there are no large suspicious MFA logs in Azure AD. For more information, see [how to use the sign-ins report to review Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication events](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-reporting).

### Additional checks

In Defender for Cloud Apps, investigate activities and file access of the compromised account. For more information, see:

- [Investigate compromise with Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/investigate)
- [Investigate anomalies with Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/investigate-anomaly-alerts)

Check whether the user has access to additional resources, such as virtual machines (VMs), domain account permissions, storage, among others.  
If data has been breached, then you should inform additional agencies, such as the police.

## Immediate remedial actions

1. Change the password of any account that is suspected to have been breached or if the account password has been discovered. Additionally, block the user. Make sure you follow the guidelines for [revoking emergency access](/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/users-revoke-access).
2. Mark any account that has been compromised as “*compromised*” in Azure Identity Protection.
3. Block the IP address of the attacker. Be cautious while performing this action as attackers can use legitimate VPNs and this could create more risk as they change IP addresses as well. If you are using Cloud Authentication, then block the IP address in Defender for Cloud Apps or Azure AD. If federated, you need to block the IP address at the firewall level in front of the ADFS service.
4. [Block legacy](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/block-legacy-authentication) authentication if it is being used (this action, however, could impact business).
5. [Enable MFA](/azure/active-directory/authentication/tutorial-enable-azure-mfa) if it is not already done.
6. [Enable Identity Protection](/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-risk-policies) for the user risk and sign-in risk
7. Check the data that has been compromised (emails, SharePoint, OneDrive, apps). See how to use the [activity filter in Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/activity-filters).
8. Maintain password hygiene. For more information, see [Azure AD password protection](https://www.microsoft.com/research/publication/password-guidance/).
9. You can also refer to [ADFS Help](https://adfshelp.microsoft.com/TroubleshootingGuides/Workflow/a73d5843-9939-4c03-80a1-adcbbf3ccec8).

Implement password protection on Azure AD and on-premises by enabling the custom-banned password lists. This configuration will prevent users from setting weak passwords or passwords associated with your organization:

### Tagging IP address

Tag the IP addresses in Defender for Cloud Apps to receive alerts related to future use:

*Tagging IP addresses*

In Defender for Cloud Apps, “tag” IP address for the IP scope and set up an alert for this IP range for future reference and accelerated response.

*Setting alerts for a specific IP address*

### Configure alerts

Depending on your organization needs, you can configure alerts.

[Set up alerting in your SIEM tool](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/siem-server-integration)  and look at improving logging gaps. Integrate ADFS, Azure AD, Office 365 and Defender for Cloud Apps logging.

Configure the threshold and alerts in ADFS Health Connect and Risky IP portal.

*Configure notifications*

See how to [configure alerts in the Identity Protection portal](/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-notifications).

### Set up sign-in risk policies with either Conditional Access or Identity Protection

- [Configure Sign-In risk](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-risk)
- [Configure User Risk](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-risk-user)
- [Configure policy alerts in Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/cloud-discovery-policies)

## Recommended defenses

- Educate end users, key stakeholders, front line operations, technical teams, cyber security and communications teams
- Review security control and make necessary changes to improve or strengthen security control within your organization
- Suggest Azure AD configuration assessment
- Run regular [attack simulator](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/attack-simulator) exercises
