# RaMP checklist â€”  Data, compliance, and governance

Data is the lifeblood and intrinsic value of many organizations, even for those whose business is primarily material goods and services instead of information. That data needs to be:

- Protected from internal and external attackers who would profit from its content or the leveraging and extortion of its value (ransomware).
- Compliant with organization policies and governmental regulations.
- Governed over time to ensure its protection and compliance and for a planned obsolescence.

Use these steps in the Zero Trust Rapid Modernization Plan (RaMP) for your data:
