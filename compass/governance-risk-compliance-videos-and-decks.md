# Microsoft Security Best Practices module: Governance, risk, and compliance
Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) activities help reduce organizational risk by ensuring policy and best practices are followed consistently over time. This section also addresses key roles and responsibilities we have found important for successfully managing cloud security. 

See the [Governance, risk, and compliance](governance.md) and [Capabilities](governance-risk-compliance-capabilities.md) topics for more information.

The following videos provide guidance on governance, risk, and compliance. To download the PowerPoint slides associated with these videos, click [download presentation slides](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/downloads/security-compass-presentation.pptx).
